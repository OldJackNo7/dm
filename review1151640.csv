For a game that classified as an ""RPG"" game  this game is not too complex. So anyone can hop in and enjoying the game  the scenery  and the story. No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft  etc). 

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now  it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad  but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

And Aloy has same energy like reboot version of Lara Croft. Blitzing through their enemies primarily with a bow and arrow and still can win no matter how strong their enemies are. So Lovely. Make me interested in Archery even more.

[h1]Detailed Review :[/h1]
[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God  no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  VMProtect  etc ( Again  take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches  for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly  but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting  etc.

[b]Informational :[/b]
- Because I said earlier ""this game is not too complex""  so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

[b]Recommend this game.

It is like the actual Witcher should fight  =)

The only cons to it is that is painfully  obviously observable  that many complicated mechanics and ideas were simplified or cut out  to make the game more accessible for halfwits casual console peasants.

All I'm saying is you (generally speaking) probably shouldn't really make bad reviews about playing on PC specifically unless you put up your specs so that others can see exactly what you're working with  remember  reviews here on steam are supposed to be helpful  you don't really help if you aren't specific. At that point  you're just ranting because you're mad that things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.

Edit: And enough to play through NG+ on Ultra Hard to get the last of the achievements ;)

If youve ever wanted to play Far Creed: Phantom Breath of the Wild Hunt Raiders Redemption  now is your chance. HZD plays like a mashup of all those games - which is both good and bad. 

Whats the bad? Almost everything can be compared to those other games  and the comparisons are frequently ""its almost as good as X but not quite"". Eg take the horse riding - it doesnt seem as good as RDR2  BOTW  or TW3  its not nearly as fluid or helpful  and instead I feel as though most of the time Im fighting a giant robot machine for control - which maybe I am. Which is a shame since you will end up spending so much time on horseback.

Whats the good? Being a blend of  and being compared to a bunch of superb games is quite an accomplishment. Combat  movement  economy  progression  ai  crafting  music  artwork  etc etc etc are all very good. 

Whats excellent? Stealth. Rocks  whistling  grass and telegraphed and forgiving AI all come together really well. I think the music and artwork are excellent  and I love the theme of the world - natural beauty and giant robot dinosaurs with laser breath! ""Squee!"" :)
 
Whats ""new"" in HZD then? Shooting giant dinosaurs with a variety of weapons to strip them of components+abilities  and to inflict status effects on them (maybe this is like Monster Hunter  but I havent played any of those). Hence the combat is a bit more cerebral than all of the games mentioned above. Anything else  anything else...? No? (Im sure if anyone reads this  someone will point out other novel stuff  but I cant remember it now).

Whats ""terrible"" (IMO): A large class of monster attacks knock Aloy to the ground/knock her back. This would be fine except a large class of Aloys attacks need to ""charge up"" (eg drawing the bow to max strength)  and so you have to frequently interrupt this  either by voluntarily rolling out of the way  or by getting hit and knocked down which also interrupts it. Some of Aloy's attacks (eg strong melee) cant be interrupted by rolling  so you'll just get knocked down. When you pick up heavy weapons  if you roll you drop them  so you have to pick them up again after. Its all very tiresome. The last time I recall being this annoyed by knockdown combat is Prototype (where the tank attacks would knock you about  stun locking you - to be clear though that was worse).

The writing is mixed: The overall story is an excellent concept  novel to me  and I really enjoyed it. The exposition through the world  text and speech  for key plot moments is superb  and backed my beautiful  haunting  fitting music  standout vs all the games Ive played in recent history and almost tear jerking. But most of it is incredibly forgettable filler stuff - fine to read/listen to  fine to ignore - but then again its hard to imagine a game with ~100 hours of play time with every written line being at the peak of the art form. The dialogue with characters can be skipped (with space) which is a blessing because while its not terrible  its fully generic and you cant make any choices of consequence - you cant make any choices at all IIRC  and hence there are no consequences for your actions  which is pretty bad for an RPG (ok  maybe there are some minor choices which involves getting a band of companions together  but this is super shallow).

There are a decent number of sidequests  errands (other side quests...?)  in addition to the main quests - Ive completed almost all of them now  but it never felt overwhelming (unlike eg the Far Creeds nearly infinite set of things to do on the map). Its quite nice having a game with such little filler. One gripe relates to the weapon tutorials - they dont progress unless you have the tutorial quest actively selected - but you can ignore them so thats fine.

Another major gripe is that just like the majority of the writing is forgettable  bland  generic and ultimately a bit pointless  so the same is true for the world map - its very pretty  but there is little point in ""exploration"" as an activity since when you get ""there""  there is nothing there. There is one ""secret special"" area of the game where if you collect a bunch of stuff during the main missions  by 90% through the game you can get a ""literally game changing"" set of armour (its not a secret though  its got a map marker and a quest associated with it...). This is in contrast to eg gothic where unique weapons could be found through random and persistent exploration all throughout the game but they were all totally missable if you didnt explore - I think it is a missed opportunity that there arent another 10-20 optional unique items which can be found purely through exploration - having this would add ""exploration"" as an extra dimension to the gameplay. I think if ~50% of the skill tree had been replaced by ""exploration found items"" the game would have felt more meaningful (or alternately if exploration found items were needed to unlock 50% of the skill tree).

All in all  I enjoyed HZD  even with its rough edges  and I would happily play a sequel (on PC). What core changes would I want to see in that?
- Choices that matter (dialogue and action)
- More ""cyber"" abilities in addition to the late game armour which dramatically mix up the gameplay  ala DX or Crysis3  discovered through the world.
- Less ""crap  med  good  great bow""  and more discovery of unique old world weapons. (More variety  less progression).
- Much less knock-down attacks  or much shorter ""build"" times for your attacks.
- Get rid of the inventory limits  managing those are a chore not a pleasure.
- A constant companion we can become attached to - horse  dog  cat  bird whatever. ""Dial a random horse"" is functional  but a missed emotional opportunity. Also  a permanent horse could be used for carrying excess inventory  necessitate fixing and upgrading  etc etc etc - all missed opportunities in HZD.
- An inventory ""wheel""  like the weapon wheel.
- Probably some more stuff  but this review is long enough already. :)",1609486204,1609741958,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False,,

The story is fantastic  and you grow a pretty strong relationship with the main character  Aloy.  Even though I have only played 8 hours  I've seen and done so much.

You can play however you want  if you want to go balls-to-the-walls killing everything in sight  go for it.  Or  if you want to play passive  you can do that to.  The controls/combat are really straightforward and feel perfect

I get about 60 FPS on average with 90% of the graphics settings on the highest setting running at a resolution of 2560x1440. I encountered one loading bug where I had to restart the game and one minor visual bug with foliage that cleared away after a short while in my 84 hours of playing the game (as of this writing). Whatever performance issues there were in the past  it seems the Guerrilla team has resolved it.

[b][u]Game Review[/u][/b]
The open world landscape is picturesque and makes you want to use photo mode a lot. Combat is solid and makes you feel like a hunter. I really liked the progression of how the story unfolded. Voice acting and character animations during character interactions were good. Although I felt that in scenes that called for sadness that dealt with death/grief  both of those aspects were very mediocre and never sold it for me. You do see an improvement in character animations in the Frozen Wilds DLC though. I give it my ""Must Play"" stamp.",1609989211,1610005530,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since the release on Play Station and seeing how good of a game it was (drawing lots of inspiration from Witcher)  watching various streamers playing it  I hoped it would come to PC too  but since Guerilla Games only made Play Station exclusives I wasn't expecting any. So I was excited to play it on PC when it was actually announced to come to PC. The disappointment was big though when not only people reported lots of trouble playing it  but on top of that all  on my system for some reason it was not even able to start up at all. So I had to ask for a refund.

By far one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever created. I've been collecting dust and nothing else since it released on PS4 in February of 2017. When it released on PC this year in 2020  I shook off the grime and Steam slapped my ass with a fresh matte coat and told me [i]""get ready for a four day bender""[/i] as I emptied my wallet. Little did Steam know I got more than my money's worth. I didn't just get a game. I got one of the best.

[b]Port to PC[/b]
PS4 to PC was done right by this one. The controls feel right  there's no clunky-ness or re-adjustments needed. Only setting I've ever altered was the FOV cause the camera felt a little off. Majority of the negative reviews are people complaining that they can't get it to run. It works fine  you just need a good build to do it. Know why? Because this game was actually ported right and they made it look amazing on Ultra.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments— astounding. Hell  I'd take one as a wallpaper and put it up in my house. Framed. Maybe get it from one of those metal poster people. Real nice. I'm not gonna lie  you're gonna question your gravitational pull with all the hair clipping into keyframes. And I've only witnessed Aloy's model reaching up to the heavens one time  so let's just say model glitches are minimal.

[b]Story[/b]
Writers— pay raise when? They did a fucking fantastic job  that's putting it lightly. It's so [i]surreal[/i] how down to Earth it is; How emotionally invested you get in the main character. How intrigued you get through each step in the plot ladder. How their take on what such a world would be like is actually understandable (trying to avoid spoilers here). Damn  even some of the side quests hit you like a fucking red light runner. By the end of the game— if you've done everything  majority of the cast has gone through character development. And once you've seen it all. . . it tugs on your heartstrings man.
But if you don't give a damn about the story  you'll definitely enjoy the

[b]Combat[/b]
Bows and arrows aren't the only thing Aloy is known for. I'm gonna have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Depending on what you're fighting  it goes from 0-100 real quick and then it's all about strategy and acting fast. You have a wide variety of ways to handle a fight. It doesn't hand-hold you through them either. You gotta learn what you can use against your targets by yourself. Read the Notebook to memorize weaknesses. Use those invis frames you get from dodge rolls  don't be afraid to give up that fully charged shot in favor of getting the hell out of the way. The easier difficulty  the more disinterested you'll be in combat. Do yourself a favor in whip that baby up  just save Ultra Hard for New Game+.

[b]Overall[/b]
Horizon's a damn good game. Yes  there's times when Aloy goes blind and misses the platforming jump. And yes  there's some slight vibe kills when the model makes the wrong expression or when all of the sudden you're stuck inside of a rock hearing combat music.
But these are [i]small[/i] issues. Small! There's definitely other weird bugs that have been noticed by other people. But what's a video game without some these days?
Good outways the bad too much on this one.

Firstly  because the PC port had a very rough launch and there are still complaints of issues popping up from time to time. Secondly  because I wasn't sure if the idea of fighting robots would really be that enjoyable past a few hours or less.

Well  regarding the first concern  it seems they've done  good job at patching this up and getting it into a more playable state. I'm about 20 hours into the game now and I've yet to encounter a single bug or crash. The worst I have seen is a floating bush or piece of scenery here and there  and such things are really rare. I'm not sure if my hardware has anything to do with my lack of issues  so I will say that I'm using an RX 5700 8GB  16GB of RAM  and an AMD Ryzen 3600.

Regarding the second concern - this is where I think the game has done a great job. You are a very young hunter armed with only a few traps  bows  and a spear  going up against massive technologically advanced robots that look like they could topple entire buildings. I think the way the game handles this bizarre juxtaposition is pretty clever. If you run head-on at enemy machines with your spear swingin'  you will almost certainly die - especially at higher difficulties (there are many  including New Game+). Even if you vastly outlevel the enemy  this tactic will still get you beat up pretty good. The key to survival and victory is to handle each enemy on a case-by-case basis and to learn and know their strengths and weaknesses. From using specialised arrows to bust off parts of the robots or using fire to set their fuel stores alight - the way you take these mechanical beasts done is both satisfying and entertaining. Especially when they collapse to the ground with a gratifying thump of jingling parts and sparks. You can attack the machines from a more aggressive angle  dancing around them while strategically damaging them enough to kill them  or you can move in the shadows and thin the herd one-by-one through target analysis and well placed spear jabs. Combat is fast  hectic  and the bigger bots can take off 3/4 of your health in a single swipe of their metal claws or jaws.

As for the other usual stuff: Graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is astounding. Everything on Aloy's body has physics applied  from her hair down to the small beads that hang from her bow. She shivers when it's cold and complains when she has water in her boots. Her movement is entirely terrain-dependant and she will interact with foliage when moving through the world. I find this sort of thing important in a game where you will be spending hours looking at a character through a third-person perspective. I'm not sure what my frame rate is as I'm not running a FPS counter when I play  but I'd say it's floating around 60 with everything but AA and shadows maxed. They have improved the performance with patches but apparently this game is a system hog  so if you have lower specs you might want to make sure you stay within your 2-hour return window just in case.

The sound and music are good  although I will say that I wish the audio quality on voice lines was higher. You can tell that the audio is compressed and not mastered as good as everything else. It's a minor complaint and it doesn't really detract from the rest of the game  but it is noteworthy.

One last thing I wanted to note. The game has a fast travel system but it requires resources  which I think is awesome. You need to craft travel packs that have things for your travel such as meat and materials. Seems like a great way of having a fast travel system while avoiding the teleport-everywhere issue that Skyrim had.",1609608111,1609608111,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since this game released for the PS4  I always had the desire to play it  but never wanted to spend the money for a console. Granted  it took over 3 years for it to come to PC  but the fact that it did at all is nothing short of amazing. 

It's not a perfect port  however  as I still experience the occasional crash  but it seems well improved from when it was first released to PC  as they are continuing to release patches. Just don't expect to run the game with lower end hardware  as it's fairly taxing  even with a 2060 and a Ryzen 5 3600. I can run the game on high settings and usually consistently get over 60 FPS  if not reach my Vsync target of 75 fps. 

As for the game itself  I have to say I've been very invested in it since I started playing. I've been enjoying the story  and I really like Aloy as the protagonist. The combat is fun and can be very intense  but I do also appreciate the fact that stealth and setting traps is also a big part of the gameplay. Not to mention the world itself is beautiful and HUGE. I'm really looking forward to continuing the story and exploring the rest of the map  as right now at 14 hours in I haven't even explored half of the map yet  let alone the expansion.

I could definitely expand on this review  but for right now I just wanted to get a recommended review out since I'm enjoying it so much. Well worth the price for me.",1609258441,1609258441,True,3,0,0.525065958499908447,0,True,False,False,,

The tropes of Sony ""western"" RPGs are strongly reflected in the game and it doesn't do anything revolutionary - it stays in the safe lane to deliver what it needs  and it pays off in a game that's easy to get into. 

Excellent Port overall - had no issues with running the game and playing with KBM. Some weird frame drops in some areas but nothing game breaking. On a i5 7600k and a 1080ti  I can achieve 60FPS 80% of the time on a 1600p Ultrawide. Settings set at Original (medium)  running Textures and Models on High  turning off motion blur and AA (unnecessary at higher resolutions).

I also run this on my second PC  which has an i5 8600k and a 1080  hooked to a 1080p projector. Runs on default Favour Quality (High) at mostly steady 60fps.

 In general  if you're like me and enjoy Open World RPGs  then this is a must get on a Sale. Games/series you would also enjoy would be Witcher 3  RDR2  Assassin's Creed  Tomb Raider  Batman  Middle-Earth  Fall Out 3 - 4  Elder Scrolls  Borderlands  Far Cry  Bioshock (less open)  Dishonored (less open).",1609553949,1609554727,True,3,0,0.524735093116760254,0,True,False,False,,

[b]Negatives.[/b]

Occasionally there's some stuttering  but it's been minor.  Rarely the game seems to freeze or pause for a fraction of a second.  It's only happened a couple times in 14 hours and hasn't really been a problem  it's just annoying.

Once in a while when using the scan ability the effects that usually pop up simply fail to appear.  It doesn't really affect gameplay and it always corrects itself in a few seconds  but it's like the game just forgets to render it once in a while.

There are a few little things that could be improved.  You collect a lot of loot but some has no use other than to sell to a trader but there is no ""sell all junk"" option.  You have to go through your inventory to find each of these items every time.  It's not a big deal but a sell all treasure/junk button would be nice.  Or just auto sell it because it's not used for anything else. 

A shader optimization starts every single time you boot up the game that takes an insanely long time.  It does speed up load times  but you don't have to wait for it and in my opinion it's not really worth waiting up to 10 minutes or more for it every time you start up the game.

I ran into one glitch where a small  weak enemy got stuck in a rock but I was still able to kill it when it moved to a certain spot.  Climbing and jumping doesn't quite work the way you'd expect all the time.  I've fallen a few times when it was clear that the character should have jumped on to a post  or other surface.  It's not always obvious what you can climb  and sometimes you can't climb some things that would actually be easier than some of the things you can climb.

[b]The good stuff.[/b]

Crafting is quick and easy  especially making ammo since you can craft it from the radial menu where you select weapons.

Looting doesn't take too long like it can in some games.  The looting animation is short  and there's a loot all button.

Combat is fun and there are a lot of ways to go about taking down enemies.  You can run in firing arrows and attacking with your spear or take a stealthy approach to pick off one enemy at a time.  You can use traps and distractions.  You can switch weapons quickly in combat and when switching weapons there is a a bullet time mechanic  time slows significantly when you bring up the radial weapon menu.  You can also unlock abilities that let you slow time while aiming ranged weapons in different situations such as while jumping  sliding  or simply aiming normally.  There are precision and area effect weapons  weapons and traps that burn  freeze  electrocute  or even rend more parts off some of the enemies.  Most weapons have multiple ammo types and swapping on the fly is quite easy.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you aren't careful  but it's not too hard to get away from most enemies.

There's a decent size skill tree in the game and early on you can focus on gathering  melee  ranged combat  stealth takedowns  and a few other things.  As you level you get tougher but also get a point to spend on skills.  Higher tier skills cost more  and all skills above the first rank of skills have prerequisite skills.  It's possible to carry several types of weapons  armour  traps  and utility items such as healing and resistance potions early in the game and as you expand your storage space you can eventually carry a lot more.  This is important as you progress because different weapons and armour are better in some situations and against some enemies.

Overall the GUI is well made and easy to use.  The menu system works well and looks good.  The graphics  sound  music  animation  and overall look of the game is all great.  I notice little things here and there  like a few hairs out of place on the main character or the slight scar on one NPC's forehead  a character whose chin wrinkles as she speaks or another who tends to smile a lot.  These little things add a lot to the game.  The voice acting is generally good  too  and there is a lot of spoken dialogue.  So far I've found the story fairly interesting  if a tad predictable.

There are a lot of difficulty settings  and also aim assist that you can toggle  so if you just want to enjoy the story or want combat to be challenging (or nigh-impossible) then you can adjust it accordingly.

Otherwise  the game will take control of your character  move you to a different scene  and you will loose all loot from unlooted bodies/chests/plants/objects on the ground. The game rewards you for searching for items everywhere  but steals your opportunities if you chat with a plot based NPC  loot a boss's body  or move forward to a quest destination. At least I don't have to worry about losing quest opportunities by not using all dialog options.

I am tired of games that find it ok to  take away your gear  take control of your character  leave you in the open to be attacked  forcefully move your character in a battle scene to be a open target  and otherwise work against you.

The character you play is slow  complains too much  is weak  cannot dodge attacks  rolls faster on the ground than she can run  her father is weak  the character is unrealistic  and the entire tribe claims to be about survival but is not. I don't believe in the philosophy of the tribe  am tired of the tribe ripping the player character a new hole  providing no support  showing no respect  and not even caring to live. The plot hole of the tribe surviving a full on tribal attack is apparently forced upon you as no one claimed to hide.

I love the mechanics  but must say one more thing. How can you not get annoyed with a NPC constantly yelling  ""I'm over here...over here...over here...come save me...someone come save me...I'm over here...I'm over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here..."" I find myself saving the game just so I can practice eliminating the annoying NPCs just to find they are invincible. The NPC yells and no creature/monster can see them. I stand on the same platform where the NPC was at  stand up  and creatures shoot at me. At the very least  can the NPC whisper or waive me down. The programmers treat the player as incompetent to play the game when they must give constant verbal notification of where the NPC is located. This has driven me angry at the game.

The controls are taken over pretty good and you can play with mouse and keyboard  but you cannot hide the face that the whole game was build upon playing with a Controller. So the gameplay  inventory and combat mechanic are feeling a little bit uncomfortably when playing with mouse and keyboard. Also you cannot assign hotkeys to your quickslot so you have to cycle through them in combat which is very bad in fast pasted action.

The Game itself is great. Story and Characters are great  Sound is great  the World looks amazing. The open Map gives you enough quests and things to find or to collect. The game understands to give you enough highquality content without getting to repetative or annoying. It is just the right amount of everything before you would get bored. So thumbs up for keeping the balance and keeping things interesting.

The Monster fights and combats can be pretty though  but would be a lot of easier with better controls. Sometimes you just stuck in animations  dont find the right weapon or item in time  get stuck on some environment prop. Also some weapons seem pretty redundant to me. 

All in all  this is a very good game. If they work on the controls and inventory a bit this could be an outstanding game.

The controls are very fluid  and they simply work - and the story so far is interesting.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a beautifully rendered open world experience.

After finishing the game (and the expansion) I can also say that the difficulty scales quite nicely.  I never felt like the game was too easy  even maxed out at level 60 with all skills  the best weapons  the best armor  etc etc.  Every encounter still required me to remember where weak points were  to shoot with precision  and to use the right elemental attacks if possible.  I was still encouraged to use stealth  and it never got old.  This is about as flawless as an open sandbox game can be...unlike Assassin's Creed Odyssey  which was just genuinely boring.

Aloy reacts with such clear responsivity to the controls that it's a pleasure to just watch her climb  explore  shoot  etc.  The graphics are phenomenal and I honestly can't recommend this game enough.",1609571488,1610221178,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,,

Bow Combat is Similar to The Witcher and Warframes (Slow mow while falling or jumping.) Very awesome and handy. The optional prep with focus such as marking all the enemies so you can keep track of them in cobat feels kinda like using binoculars in Ghost Recon: Wildlands. As for the Crafting it is very simple yet crucial  so you will have arrows and potions and such.

Basically  my friends told me it was like tomb raider  which I have never played  but what I consider similar in play-style is like.. assassin's creed  or maybe even something like.. Well I don't know  it's like assassin's creed to me. But different. I mean there is the element of stealth that you have to have in order to kind of survive to get around the world  like sneaking so you don't use up all of your medicine pouch  which can be a pain in the butt to refill. But then there has been one straight up fight with like a mini-boss and a semi-boss  not sure what an actual boss looks like in this game. The first one is like.. it will wreck your crap if you don't kill it stealthily  the second one  there is no stealth in order to win  it's a straight up fight  and you gotta dodge roll  and run  until you can get some shots on it. Overall  I would rate it a 8/10 as far as gameplay and mechanics  but story-telling it is like a 9/10  I would give it a 10  but like sometimes when it is telling the story it doesn't explain some things  and if you gives you a lot of options for speech  and I would really recommend using them to get the whole picture of the story.

They nailed this game. If I had to pick a favorite game right now  it would be this one.

The open world feels a lot more open than it does in most ""open-world"" games and characters are fleshed out and interesting to converse with. The combat requires you to utilize a few different weapon types to serve very unique purposes in order to take down everything from small to enormous machines. This combined with the excellent sound and visual effects  along with the use of weak spots and specific machine parts that can be damaged or knocked off to affect the machines in different ways makes the combat feel very satisfying. All I will say about the story here is that it is very original and that you should avoid learning anything about it before you play because the way it unfolds is masterful.

I completed the main storyline in 38 hours - though you could spend more or less time depending on how you play  your skill level  and the difficulty setting you choose. I played fairly leisurely and spent time doing some of HZD's exceptionally well made side quests but I also pushed ahead in the main story in long bursts because of how interesting it was. I will definitely be playing past the main story.

Since I like both those games  I can only recommand HZD.

The good:
- Beautiful game
- Interesting story (so far) and lore
- Smooth controls
- What was said above

The meh:
- Fighting is sometimes tiring: some enemies are sinks of hit points and the 3 ways to fight I found so far are not quite satisfying:
 * (arrow  arrow  dodge  dodge) × repeat 50 times
 * (dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  hit) × repeat until you get somewhat hit and change to another strategy
 * (stealth  stealth strike  flee) × repeat 4  5 times per enemy (the quickest strategy I found  except with flying enemies… f*ck dem flying enemies)
I understand that it is important to hit weak part of the enemy  but it is not always that easy… (Ok  I know  git gud  all that)
- There are too much crafting and upgrading materials
- I am using a custom keyboard configuration  but I can't rebind keys to match my configuration (some keys are locked…) And before you roar at me  I CAN'T play with a controller…

The story is SUCH an interesting concept  It had me hooked from the beginning. And the characters are very interesting. I just wanted to find out more  get more answers. I couldn't stop playing  and I can't wait for Horizon 2.

The combat system is one of the best I've ever experienced in a game  I really can't put it into words but you feel so much in control  you can do really cool kills and it really feels like you're the one doing it. Not like other games where you press a button and the whole epic kill becomes an animation that does the job for you.

The crafting system is not too simple / dumb  and not too hard either as some games that requires you to have 10 different pieces just to make one single arrow. (which get annoying after a while with thousands of pieces in your inventory) I feel this had a great balance to it.

What i don't like:
- Good lore but the story itself is not so much. But the ending is good so there's that. 
- It feels empty without good soundtracks
- Aside from Aloy other characters pretty much forgettable
- Facial animation is bad

I'm a sucker for story driven games with interesting lore (I read the fuck out of every lore entry in games) and this game delivers on that and much more. The combat and enemies are so much more engaging than nearly every other game like it out there. Seriously  every time you meet a new enemy all you think is 'holy shit'. And the progression is insane  enemies who you first think are super hard later get easy when you figure out how to beat them and at that point you're fighting machines way scarier than you could ever have imagined. It's awesome. And it's really cool that stealth is quite viable for the most part  it feels so good when you take down a bunch of machines with stealth successfully. 

And the graphics in this game just blew me away. It's a game made in 2017 for PS4 and yet to me the PC port looks like a game made in 2020(I ran it on max settings at 1080p). The environments are just absolutely stunning  you'll keep wanting to take photos with photo mode at every step of the way. The lighting and clouds especially give everything such an awe-inspiring feeling.

The story was great too  I usually love female protagonists and this game writes Aloy really well in my opinion. The things she goes through and her search for the truth give you a lot of respect and appreciation for the character. She's a badass for sure but she still has complexity and heartfelt moments to her that make her very memorable. 

To sum up  this game has an amazing world and lore  robot dinosaurs  dynamic combat that actually makes you switch things up instead of just spamming projectiles and a visually stunning environment even though the game is 3 years old. If you like any of these things at all you won't be disappointed. I tend to give up games super quick or don't finish them -  AC Odyssey  Valhalla  Witcher 3 and Skyrim are all games I liked for a while but got bored of eventually. This game wasn't one of those though. The story length is also just perfect if you're like me and get bored easily. I'm grateful they ported this over to PC or I'd never have played it.

It is all the more astonishing because the game screws up so much: 
The progress of the abilities  which you unlock  are messed up as if by design (“You want to hit harder with your spear? Good  then you have to eat dirt and unlock two bow abilities first.”)
But the main screw ups are the characters and the dialogues. Though the premise of the game world is interesting  the main story line is a bit awkward and the characters are  even for a computer game  incredibly flat and unbelievable. A girl who has spent her whole life with one person in the wilderness  is always cocky  self-assured and better informed about everything than everyone else and is also better at everything than everybody else. A king who just lost his lover to a torturer and who – so we are made to believe up to this point – is not a shallow person  immediately falls for our heroine. It is an obvious problem that computer games which want to appeal to broad player base have to do a lot of wish fulfillment. Good games succeed in hiding the sickening sweetness of this day dreaming by wrapping it in a realistic setting  showing the character developing their skills over time. But in Horizon this progress has happened before we start to play the main part of the game. Even worse  all other characters just exist in order to feed in these delusions of grandeur. In some way  this game puts you into the mind of a narcissistic sociopath  who not only wants to feel “I am the most attractive and strongest and …’”  but needs to be reassured about this constantly by everyone else: from a random passerby to the king (and who cares about character consistency  right?). Depressingly enough  the game designers of Horizon Zero Dawn seem to believe that the prototypical player of their game is such a narcissist that he/she will take the sweet pill without any bitter coating.
So if you can ignore all these dialogues with their cringy appeal to you self-love (stuff like ‘When I met you  I thought I am the older and more experienced but now I see…’ or ‘you have discovered in a very short time more than I have in decades’ and many more)  there are some really good fights waiting for you there.",1609512202,1609513710,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,,

Most recent patch actually broke the game worse than it was before patch. EVERY time you start the game  it has to ""optimize shaders "" which takes about 20 minutes on my fairly modern machine. Prior to the patch you only had to optimize shaders the first time you ran the game. Now it's like the shader cache isn't being saved between sessions.

There is a good story with a strong delivery  likable characters and strong acting from the casts. I really  really like Aloy as the main character as she is witty  strong  smart  and so much fun to play as. The world building is also great. How the landscape is portrayed is just beautiful. I keep wanting for more content  bigger world  but then  if the world is bigger but the content is sparse  it won't be as enjoyable. I don't know.

Gameplay is also enjoyable and a lot of fun. There are many paths to take in term of how you approach a situation. Whether you come blazing  shooting arrows in an action movie style  or you can just take it quietly  using stealth  dispatching your adversaries one by one and taking your time patiently. If anything I feel lacking is the melee combat. I feel it can be enriched further variety-wise. But overall  gameplay is amazing.

Music and ambience supports the adventure greatly  imho. When you just run around in the field  the approach of enemies  the tense tunes of the heated battles are all just beautiful. Never I felt music or sounds out of place or out of pace. 

Again  there are problems. Technical problems like crashing  or texture not loading properly (my character suddenly didn't have a body when I equipped the shield weave a couple of times)  and other problems you can find in the forums. It's not a perfect game  but if you ask me whether I enjoy it  the answer is yes  very much.

The story is pretty good from what I've seen so far. Cutscenes are actually interesting and I don't skip through them  like with some other games. In addition to the main quest line  there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy. Most of them have been simple but fun.

Combat is nice. Keep in mind that this is not a game where you can go all out against multiple enemies at once. This is a surefire way to end up dead. You can take on maybe one or two enemies at a time but the best strategy is to use ranged combat. Aloy has a variety of bows and tripwire-type traps at her disposal and it would behoove you to learn how to use them all. Aloy has the tools in her arsenal  so why not put them all to good use; the game gives you plenty of opportunity to do so. Either way  plan out your encounters and make the most of the weapons and terrain.

Exploration is also fun. The world is varied and rich. I find myself wandering about and constantly looking around in amazement at how beautiful the world is. If you have the appropriate hardware  crank this game up to max and let your jaw hit the floor.

That said  performance-wise  HZD seems to run great. Whatever bugs there were at launch have been fixed and the game runs smooth as butter on my system. I am running a 3700X  3080  16GB 3600 RAM and have the game installed on a 1TB 970 Evo Plus. I usually let the game run on my TV (LG CX 55"") and with everything at max settings and 4K  I average between 70-80 FPS. At 1440p  I get between 90-110. As stated  there have been no hiccups and the game runs smooth as butter.

All in all  my experience has been great. I can turn HZD on and before I know it  hours have passed and I have to force myself to turn the computer off.

This game is breathtaking  in many ways  but mostly in art style/ visuals and story line. The characters you meet feel quite realistic in their personalities and the story is a nice blend of many fitting ingredients; futuristic and historic at the same time. A downside is maybe a bit too much religious superstition  but it fits the story pretty well. Also it is clearly a game developed in the first place for console. This is visible in the movement/fighting controls of the main character which can feel a bit clunky sometimes. And the insane loading time of 2 5 minutes in the start menu (while it's installed on my M2 SSD) was very awkward  but after running the optimization and a few more restarts it's now much better.

As it is  there is too much fighting  not enough peaceful lore and interaction for my tastes. To narrate Aloy (the main protagonist of the game): Just a few minutes of quiet. Usually that quiet doesn't last for minutes  if I don't try to be stealthy.

Since there is a constant need to gather resources  confrontations are unavoidable.

The Cauldrons are weird places  especially if considering they should have been built by modern technology standards.

Someties new machines appearing randomy still irritates me.

Upgraded my PC to 16GB RAM and it helped a lot. Very seldom loading lags after it and quitting the game went from a minute to a few seconds. 

I really enjoy the visuals while ""rappling down"" a cliff.

Lo que en un principio fué un horrible port con muchos fallos gráficos y técnicos (perdí un save como de 8hrs después de que un NPC no apareció para continuar una misión)  terminó siendo una experiencia muy buena. Al principio  el juego me iba entre 30 y 40fps en medium settings  pero después del parche 1.05 ya me comenzó a ir a 60fps estables en altos  al menos un 95% del tiempo.

La historia es bastante interesante  la música es buena (sólo si me aburrió de a madres la música en el mapa/menú)  el doblaje de voz en español latino es muy bueno (aunque yo lo jugué en inglés  el lip sync es muy bueno)  el gameplay es bastante sencillo pero divertido y el sistema de inventario  skill tree  crafting y demás es bastante robusto y muy fácil cuando se le agarra la onda. En general  lo recomiendo.

PRO:
+Los gráficos: Corre muy bien con una 1660Ti  i5 9300H y 16Gb RAM desde un SSD.
+El doblaje en español latino: Empieza muy bien (escuchando a Rubén Moya)  pero en inglés considero que es mejor.
+El mapa es muy grande y hay muchas cosas por hacer/coleccionar.
+La duración: Te lo puedes aventar en unas 20horas si solo vas por la historia principal  aunque yo me aventé 50+ porque también jugué misiones secundarias y el DLC.
+El DLC: Te da bastantes horas de juego  mayor dificultad y muchos niveles de experiencia. Está integrado totalmente al juego como una misión secundaria.
+La historia: Al principio da flojera  pero ya para el final si te quedas con ganas de que ya salga el 2 (y obvio que tenga su port en PC).
+El precio: El precio es super competitivo y por la cantidad de horas de juego que te da  es un gran deal.

CONTRAS:
-El filtro anisotrópico NO sirve
-El DLC está como una misión secundaria mas  por lo que es confuso si se debe hacer antes de terminar el juego  o después  o en qué momento. Yo recomiendo hacerlo cuando ya se tenga un nivel 35 o bien  omitirlo si solo se quiere hacer la historia principal porque si son bastantes horas de juego (6-10).
-El sistema de inventario: Se llena de mucha porquería que no sabes si utilizarás mas adelante o no  es medio molesto tener que estar eliminando cosas.
-Muchísimo coleccionable (es bueno o malo según tu punto de vista).
-Al juego le hace falta un gancho tipo Far Cry Primal con la opción de poder subir rápidamente montañas en lugar de tener que estar rodeando todo.

En general  muy recomendable si te gustan juegos tipo Far Cry  AC (mas o menos como Odyssey) y un combate similar a la nueva trilogía de Tomb Raider (obvio sin pistolas  puro arco).",1609864325,1609864325,True,1,1,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False,,

Fun game overall  the world building is where this game shines don't expect too much from the combat  story or the characters too much.
1. Combat is alright but can be tedious or just annoying especially if you don't take advantage of using your focus to see weak points and its specially tedious at the higher difficulties and in the frozen wilds but can be fun if you learn weak points and attack patterns  (which aren't all that complicated a bit one dimensional)  but that's just the combats with the machines which can be summed up as pretty much 'Fun when learned but somewhat tedious and just a bit annoying at higher difficulties' it isn't that challenging even at the hardest difficulties if I'm honest. Though that is what i can say about combat with machines  combat with humans in this game pretty much sucks ass  grunts are almost always a single head shot and down (though there are some exceptions later on) but the 'boss' mobs are needlessly tanky  spear play against humans is terrible as well  for some reason they are like are all like immovable objects when hit by spear power attacks and yet you can knock over machines which would weigh hundreds of kilos or even tonnes and yet these 80 - 100 kg humans just phase tank that crap. 
2. The base game Story is pretty predictable and the only good stuff I can say about the story is the world building that comes with it  I won't spoil it but its just fun learning about why the world ended up this way and all the stuff surrounding it. The side missions don't add much either except maybe interacting with characters you could probably go through the the game without doing the side missions and you wouldn't have an experience much different from someone who has except for maybe levels  the first few hours spear upgrade  the hunters lodge weapons and the cauldron overrides.
2.5. The DLC Story is pretty well done and enjoyable especially doing it just before the final mission. Some of the enemies in this dlc though pretty much sum up up my tedious and annoying feelings on combat especially the final machine introduced  the additional world buildings is really good and introduces some information/concept which may become a focus in the next game.
3. Characters in this game are well NPCs  I know that seems dumb and obvious but well that's the best description I can really offer  there wasn't much depth to characters without you actively trying to find it in going through  all the dialog but the main side characters weren't all that interesting beyond like 3 of them  while the side missions with them had some fun moments they were pretty forgettable as characters. Aloy as much as I enjoyed playing as her was sometimes jarring to watch play through a cut scene because it felt like there her character wasn't consistent sometimes but overall i think shes an interesting character with some interesting stuff behind her (could put it better but I don't want to spoil story stuff). The additional lore side characters you find out about during the story were pretty interesting especially in the context of what was happening back with them. The main DLC characters were interesting added to the overall experience and I can't really say much about the beyond they were pretty average good characters some of the side character from the side quests were interesting but didn't really stick.
3.5 This point is probably one of if not the biggest gripe/mild irritation with this game that brought me out of my immersion at points in the story because it felt really ham-fisted and a little forced at points. It was inserting modern politics into a world which has supposedly become more tribal / 'regressed' from todays societal norms. I can tell of a few examples without spoiling too much  one being at the start of the game where you meet with the envoy of a previously hostile tribes leader  the sun king  and during the conversation she asks if there is ever been a 'sun queen' and he says no and that begins a conversation which just make sense in the context of the world that is shown  two this probably isn't really to do with anything overt but every main antagonist in this game has been male  every single one and most of the important NPCs with power bar like 2 or 3 are women as well which doesn't make much sense outside her Nora tribe because there is lore reasons  I mean I have no problem with women with powerful positions in general but when the skew is so large in a game that has humans regressed to tribal societies and survival requires strength in 9/10 cases it doesn't make sense for all the powerful people to be women. But I think its worse in the context that every antagonist is male and pretty much all the side characters you meet all have a women in their lives they view as braver and stronger than them. I don't know it doesn't effect the game to a large degree and at some points I enjoyed it but at some points it was like being whiplashed out of my immersion and cringing at some of the things said and i think my biggest disappointment with this stuff was the missed opportunity of making Aloy a mold breaking character in this new tribal society and it could have worked but you can't break something that's been broken  multiple times  that's why my biggest gripe with this is instead of actually making Aloy influence the breaking of the mold they instead pretended there is a mold to break while patting Aloy on the back for breaking the mold.
Conclusion:
Ultimately I think this a game worth a try because the overall story with all the world building is the best I've seen in a long time and the characters do have their moments. The visuals are really well done and exploring while a chore at times is one of this games charm points and the music that accompanies it is great as well and is hard to fault. While it was a bit buggy here and there there wasn't anything major and only crashed once in the second last mission when loading an area I pressed a lot of buttons at the same time. Probably going in my top 10 which may seem strange from the score and the way I went on in the section above but well while I said all that it isn't that bad and isn't noticeable outside of times it feels off putting it nicely  the score went down due to just a lot of inconvenient stuff that is in the game which all have to due with combat  exploration and item storage and the fact that a lot of the hours you get out of this game just seem padded out in the form of exploration and collecting with the side quest not really offering to much beyond track this or kill that but yeah. I hope this was helpful  I'm mainly doing this out of venting mostly and wanting to put my impressions down somewhere well I hope you enjoy the game if you do get as I really think its worth playing through at least once.",1609574412,1609574412,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False,,

You basically spend half the time running to missions and running away from the machines. Of the 23 hours it took about 8-9 hours to get to the missions. The melee is also pretty bad. The boss fights are either those flying feckers or the deathbringers and no matter what weapons you have  you are no match for that machine. You will either keep dying or you'd spend an hour trying to cower while killing them.

The actual story is probably 10-15 hours long but it takes this long because you have run around or redo missions multiple times. The fast travel system is also annoying because it doesn't take you super close to the missions and if it does  it's not free. You have to make fast travel packs. WHY?!

The player character  Aloy  must go on a quest to investigate the origin of the machines and the fall of the previous civilization.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Along her journey  Aloy will fight against machines and Human bandits. The design of the machines is really cool. Their appearance and behaviour is similar to animals such as horses  cows  tigers  bulls  crabs  crocodiles  hawks  or dinosaurs like the velociraptor  brontosaurus and t-rex. As well as melee attacks  some of them have laser weapons mounted on their back  or can spam fire or frost projectiles at you  and one machine even has a cloaking device.

•	Most bandits are armed with axe or bow  but their leaders have powerful heavy weapons like a minigun or grenade launcher  which you can pick up and use until they run out of ammo.

•	Aloy can wield a staff for melee attacks and various different types of bows which can shoot arrows enhanced with elemental damage. Fire does extra damage over time  frost will slow enemy movement and increase damage taken  while shock will stun them for a few seconds leaving them vulnerable to a critical melee attack. There’s also a really useful skill which lets you load up two or three arrows to fire simultaneously with any bow.

•	There’s a strong focus on using stealth  hiding in long grass to sneak past groups of powerful enemies  or getting close enough to perform a melee takedown on weaker enemies.

•	Combat can be quite tactical. One of my favourite weapons  the Tripcaster  lets you place explosive or shock tripwires on the ground  which will detonate when a machine runs over them. Before the start of a fight  I liked to place a few tripwires in strategic locations  between trees or rocks  then I’d stand with the tripwires between myself and the machines  shooting the machines with arrows while trying to lure them into charging through the tripwires.

•	Some machines have weak points that can be targeted to deal extra damage  or you can destroy their weapon components to reduce their threat to you  although this can be tricky when fighting against fast moving or flying enemies. Its actually easier when fighting bosses because of their huge size and slower movement.

•	You can unlock the ability to override machines to make them fight each other  or to use them as a mount to travel around the world quicker. I didn’t use mounts often because I quickly discovered that this will draw aggro from lots of nearby enemies (similar to driving a car in a Far Cry game)  so its less stressful to just sneak around on foot.

•	You can buy several outfits from traders which change Aloy’s appearance. Weapons and outfits can be upgraded with modifications which provide bonuses to various damage types  damage resistances  or stealth.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is very well written with an interesting sense of mystery  and I enjoyed slowly piecing together what happened in the old world. The conflict between Humans and machines has similarities to the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix.

•	Most side quests have unique stories which are of a similar quality level to those in Witcher 3  and much better than the copy and paste tasks usually found in open world games. Sometimes you’ll wander across machines and Humans fighting each other  while clearing bandit camps will allow friendly tribes to move in. All of these elements help to bring the world to life.

•	Voice acting is fantastic  especially Ashly Burch (who previously voiced Chloe in Life is Strange) as Aloy and Lance Reddick (Fringe  Quantum Break) who plays an important supporting character.

•	Lip syncing during cutscenes is the best I’ve seen since Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	The environment looks fantastic  from the forests  rivers and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

•	I had a smooth framerate during combat with machines and while exploring the world. The only significant problems I encountered were around a few bandit camps where my framerate dipped into the 40s  I’m assuming this was caused by columns of smoke because I didn’t see them anywhere else. I had some minor framerate drops in large settlements of NPCs  which wasn’t the end of the world because it didn’t affect any fast paced gameplay.

•	It took me 61 hours to complete the main quest  expansion  and lots of side quests. During this time I only crashed twice  so the game was very stable for me. Both crashes occurred before the release of patch 1.06 so it seems that whatever was causing the problem has been fixed.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

•	The camera has a mind of its own  sometimes changing position by itself. By default  Aloy will be slightly offset to the left of screen  like most third person games. However  there are times when the camera drifts so that Aloy is almost all the way to the right of the screen  which feels slightly disorienting. Its not an issue that makes the game unplayable  because you can immediately reset the camera position by aiming the bow. This also means its not a problem during combat because you’ll almost always be aiming. Its just a really strange design decision that doesn’t serve any purpose  and I can’t think of any other game I’ve played in the last few years where I’ve felt like I’m fighting the camera.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and I rate it as an absolute must play for action game fans. Combat and story are both excellent and while there are some technical flaws  they aren’t big enough reasons to avoid playing.

For a game that classified as an ""RPG"" game  this game is not too complex. So anyone can hop in and enjoying the game  the scenery  and the story. No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft  etc). 

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now  it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad  but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

And Aloy has same energy like reboot version of Lara Croft. Blitzing through their enemies primarily with a bow and arrow and still can win no matter how strong their enemies are. So Lovely. Make me interested in Archery even more.

[h1]Detailed Review :[/h1]
[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God  no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  VMProtect  etc ( Again  take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches  for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly  but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting  etc.

[b]Informational :[/b]
- Because I said earlier ""this game is not too complex""  so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

I really want to recommend this game. I do. It is an absolute masterpiece and I loved playing it… on the PS4. On PC this game is nearly unplayable unless you have only the top of the line hardware or willing to play one of the most beautiful games of the last generation on settings that make it look like minecraft. It barely hits 60fps with major graphical downgrades for me and I have a 2070 Super FTW3 card.

Now  will I remove my review if the Devs fix these issues? Absolutely. That hand will flip to a thumbs up and I will get to write a review about the gameplay itself. But  as it stands  you might be better off picking this game up on the PS4/5. And that pains me to say as a proud member of PCMR.

--Edit as of 11/27/20--
The dev is proving to be committed to this game and is patching it at a fast pace. Some issues have been fixed but many more remain. FPS is still very jittery and can rip you right out of the experience. While there is improvement  it might be many more months till this is what I consider playable.

--Edit as of 12/04/20--
I have 100% this game now  and let me tell you it was much easier on the PS4. The game would crash at the worst times and the frame lag would make some battles more about where  could I lure the enemy where I could get a smoother framerate rather than just trying to take down the enemy. A 40+ frame drop at the wrong time could mean having to reload a save.

I will say the 1.08 patch DID help with many of the issues  it just isn't enough though the devs are making great improvements. While I can not endorse this game as is  I highly suspect that will change in the future.

Edit: And enough to play through NG+ on Ultra Hard to get the last of the achievements ;)

If youve ever wanted to play Far Creed: Phantom Breath of the Wild Hunt Raiders Redemption  now is your chance. HZD plays like a mashup of all those games - which is both good and bad. 

Whats the bad? Almost everything can be compared to those other games  and the comparisons are frequently ""its almost as good as X but not quite"". Eg take the horse riding - it doesnt seem as good as RDR2  BOTW  or TW3  its not nearly as fluid or helpful  and instead I feel as though most of the time Im fighting a giant robot machine for control - which maybe I am. Which is a shame since you will end up spending so much time on horseback.

Whats the good? Being a blend of  and being compared to a bunch of superb games is quite an accomplishment. Combat  movement  economy  progression  ai  crafting  music  artwork  etc etc etc are all very good. 

Whats excellent? Stealth. Rocks  whistling  grass and telegraphed and forgiving AI all come together really well. I think the music and artwork are excellent  and I love the theme of the world - natural beauty and giant robot dinosaurs with laser breath! ""Squee!"" :)
 
Whats ""new"" in HZD then? Shooting giant dinosaurs with a variety of weapons to strip them of components+abilities  and to inflict status effects on them (maybe this is like Monster Hunter  but I havent played any of those). Hence the combat is a bit more cerebral than all of the games mentioned above. Anything else  anything else...? No? (Im sure if anyone reads this  someone will point out other novel stuff  but I cant remember it now).

Whats ""terrible"" (IMO): A large class of monster attacks knock Aloy to the ground/knock her back. This would be fine except a large class of Aloys attacks need to ""charge up"" (eg drawing the bow to max strength)  and so you have to frequently interrupt this  either by voluntarily rolling out of the way  or by getting hit and knocked down which also interrupts it. Some of Aloy's attacks (eg strong melee) cant be interrupted by rolling  so you'll just get knocked down. When you pick up heavy weapons  if you roll you drop them  so you have to pick them up again after. Its all very tiresome. The last time I recall being this annoyed by knockdown combat is Prototype (where the tank attacks would knock you about  stun locking you - to be clear though that was worse).

The writing is mixed: The overall story is an excellent concept  novel to me  and I really enjoyed it. The exposition through the world  text and speech  for key plot moments is superb  and backed my beautiful  haunting  fitting music  standout vs all the games Ive played in recent history and almost tear jerking. But most of it is incredibly forgettable filler stuff - fine to read/listen to  fine to ignore - but then again its hard to imagine a game with ~100 hours of play time with every written line being at the peak of the art form. The dialogue with characters can be skipped (with space) which is a blessing because while its not terrible  its fully generic and you cant make any choices of consequence - you cant make any choices at all IIRC  and hence there are no consequences for your actions  which is pretty bad for an RPG (ok  maybe there are some minor choices which involves getting a band of companions together  but this is super shallow).

There are a decent number of sidequests  errands (other side quests...?)  in addition to the main quests - Ive completed almost all of them now  but it never felt overwhelming (unlike eg the Far Creeds nearly infinite set of things to do on the map). Its quite nice having a game with such little filler. One gripe relates to the weapon tutorials - they dont progress unless you have the tutorial quest actively selected - but you can ignore them so thats fine.

Another major gripe is that just like the majority of the writing is forgettable  bland  generic and ultimately a bit pointless  so the same is true for the world map - its very pretty  but there is little point in ""exploration"" as an activity since when you get ""there""  there is nothing there. There is one ""secret special"" area of the game where if you collect a bunch of stuff during the main missions  by 90% through the game you can get a ""literally game changing"" set of armour (its not a secret though  its got a map marker and a quest associated with it...). This is in contrast to eg gothic where unique weapons could be found through random and persistent exploration all throughout the game but they were all totally missable if you didnt explore - I think it is a missed opportunity that there arent another 10-20 optional unique items which can be found purely through exploration - having this would add ""exploration"" as an extra dimension to the gameplay. I think if ~50% of the skill tree had been replaced by ""exploration found items"" the game would have felt more meaningful (or alternately if exploration found items were needed to unlock 50% of the skill tree).

All in all  I enjoyed HZD  even with its rough edges  and I would happily play a sequel (on PC). What core changes would I want to see in that?
- Choices that matter (dialogue and action)
- More ""cyber"" abilities in addition to the late game armour which dramatically mix up the gameplay  ala DX or Crysis3  discovered through the world.
- Less ""crap  med  good  great bow""  and more discovery of unique old world weapons. (More variety  less progression).
- Much less knock-down attacks  or much shorter ""build"" times for your attacks.
- Get rid of the inventory limits  managing those are a chore not a pleasure.
- A constant companion we can become attached to - horse  dog  cat  bird whatever. ""Dial a random horse"" is functional  but a missed emotional opportunity. Also  a permanent horse could be used for carrying excess inventory  necessitate fixing and upgrading  etc etc etc - all missed opportunities in HZD.
- An inventory ""wheel""  like the weapon wheel.
- Probably some more stuff  but this review is long enough already. :)",1609486204,1609741958,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False,,

The story is fantastic  and you grow a pretty strong relationship with the main character  Aloy.  Even though I have only played 8 hours  I've seen and done so much.

I get about 60 FPS on average with 90% of the graphics settings on the highest setting running at a resolution of 2560x1440. I encountered one loading bug where I had to restart the game and one minor visual bug with foliage that cleared away after a short while in my 84 hours of playing the game (as of this writing). Whatever performance issues there were in the past  it seems the Guerrilla team has resolved it.

[b][u]Game Review[/u][/b]
The open world landscape is picturesque and makes you want to use photo mode a lot. Combat is solid and makes you feel like a hunter. I really liked the progression of how the story unfolded. Voice acting and character animations during character interactions were good. Although I felt that in scenes that called for sadness that dealt with death/grief  both of those aspects were very mediocre and never sold it for me. You do see an improvement in character animations in the Frozen Wilds DLC though. I give it my ""Must Play"" stamp.",1609989211,1610005530,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since the release on Play Station and seeing how good of a game it was (drawing lots of inspiration from Witcher)  watching various streamers playing it  I hoped it would come to PC too  but since Guerilla Games only made Play Station exclusives I wasn't expecting any. So I was excited to play it on PC when it was actually announced to come to PC. The disappointment was big though when not only people reported lots of trouble playing it  but on top of that all  on my system for some reason it was not even able to start up at all. So I had to ask for a refund.

By far one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever created. I've been collecting dust and nothing else since it released on PS4 in February of 2017. When it released on PC this year in 2020  I shook off the grime and Steam slapped my ass with a fresh matte coat and told me [i]""get ready for a four day bender""[/i] as I emptied my wallet. Little did Steam know I got more than my money's worth. I didn't just get a game. I got one of the best.

[b]Port to PC[/b]
PS4 to PC was done right by this one. The controls feel right  there's no clunky-ness or re-adjustments needed. Only setting I've ever altered was the FOV cause the camera felt a little off. Majority of the negative reviews are people complaining that they can't get it to run. It works fine  you just need a good build to do it. Know why? Because this game was actually ported right and they made it look amazing on Ultra.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments— astounding. Hell  I'd take one as a wallpaper and put it up in my house. Framed. Maybe get it from one of those metal poster people. Real nice. I'm not gonna lie  you're gonna question your gravitational pull with all the hair clipping into keyframes. And I've only witnessed Aloy's model reaching up to the heavens one time  so let's just say model glitches are minimal.

[b]Story[/b]
Writers— pay raise when? They did a fucking fantastic job  that's putting it lightly. It's so [i]surreal[/i] how down to Earth it is; How emotionally invested you get in the main character. How intrigued you get through each step in the plot ladder. How their take on what such a world would be like is actually understandable (trying to avoid spoilers here). Damn  even some of the side quests hit you like a fucking red light runner. By the end of the game— if you've done everything  majority of the cast has gone through character development. And once you've seen it all. . . it tugs on your heartstrings man.
But if you don't give a damn about the story  you'll definitely enjoy the

[b]Combat[/b]
Bows and arrows aren't the only thing Aloy is known for. I'm gonna have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Depending on what you're fighting  it goes from 0-100 real quick and then it's all about strategy and acting fast. You have a wide variety of ways to handle a fight. It doesn't hand-hold you through them either. You gotta learn what you can use against your targets by yourself. Read the Notebook to memorize weaknesses. Use those invis frames you get from dodge rolls  don't be afraid to give up that fully charged shot in favor of getting the hell out of the way. The easier difficulty  the more disinterested you'll be in combat. Do yourself a favor in whip that baby up  just save Ultra Hard for New Game+.

[b]Overall[/b]
Horizon's a damn good game. Yes  there's times when Aloy goes blind and misses the platforming jump. And yes  there's some slight vibe kills when the model makes the wrong expression or when all of the sudden you're stuck inside of a rock hearing combat music.
But these are [i]small[/i] issues. Small! There's definitely other weird bugs that have been noticed by other people. But what's a video game without some these days?
Good outways the bad too much on this one.

Firstly  because the PC port had a very rough launch and there are still complaints of issues popping up from time to time. Secondly  because I wasn't sure if the idea of fighting robots would really be that enjoyable past a few hours or less.

Well  regarding the first concern  it seems they've done  good job at patching this up and getting it into a more playable state. I'm about 20 hours into the game now and I've yet to encounter a single bug or crash. The worst I have seen is a floating bush or piece of scenery here and there  and such things are really rare. I'm not sure if my hardware has anything to do with my lack of issues  so I will say that I'm using an RX 5700 8GB  16GB of RAM  and an AMD Ryzen 3600.

Regarding the second concern - this is where I think the game has done a great job. You are a very young hunter armed with only a few traps  bows  and a spear  going up against massive technologically advanced robots that look like they could topple entire buildings. I think the way the game handles this bizarre juxtaposition is pretty clever. If you run head-on at enemy machines with your spear swingin'  you will almost certainly die - especially at higher difficulties (there are many  including New Game+). Even if you vastly outlevel the enemy  this tactic will still get you beat up pretty good. The key to survival and victory is to handle each enemy on a case-by-case basis and to learn and know their strengths and weaknesses. From using specialised arrows to bust off parts of the robots or using fire to set their fuel stores alight - the way you take these mechanical beasts done is both satisfying and entertaining. Especially when they collapse to the ground with a gratifying thump of jingling parts and sparks. You can attack the machines from a more aggressive angle  dancing around them while strategically damaging them enough to kill them  or you can move in the shadows and thin the herd one-by-one through target analysis and well placed spear jabs. Combat is fast  hectic  and the bigger bots can take off 3/4 of your health in a single swipe of their metal claws or jaws.

As for the other usual stuff: Graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is astounding. Everything on Aloy's body has physics applied  from her hair down to the small beads that hang from her bow. She shivers when it's cold and complains when she has water in her boots. Her movement is entirely terrain-dependant and she will interact with foliage when moving through the world. I find this sort of thing important in a game where you will be spending hours looking at a character through a third-person perspective. I'm not sure what my frame rate is as I'm not running a FPS counter when I play  but I'd say it's floating around 60 with everything but AA and shadows maxed. They have improved the performance with patches but apparently this game is a system hog  so if you have lower specs you might want to make sure you stay within your 2-hour return window just in case.

The sound and music are good  although I will say that I wish the audio quality on voice lines was higher. You can tell that the audio is compressed and not mastered as good as everything else. It's a minor complaint and it doesn't really detract from the rest of the game  but it is noteworthy.

One last thing I wanted to note. The game has a fast travel system but it requires resources  which I think is awesome. You need to craft travel packs that have things for your travel such as meat and materials. Seems like a great way of having a fast travel system while avoiding the teleport-everywhere issue that Skyrim had.",1609608111,1609608111,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since this game released for the PS4  I always had the desire to play it  but never wanted to spend the money for a console. Granted  it took over 3 years for it to come to PC  but the fact that it did at all is nothing short of amazing. 

It's not a perfect port  however  as I still experience the occasional crash  but it seems well improved from when it was first released to PC  as they are continuing to release patches. Just don't expect to run the game with lower end hardware  as it's fairly taxing  even with a 2060 and a Ryzen 5 3600. I can run the game on high settings and usually consistently get over 60 FPS  if not reach my Vsync target of 75 fps. 

As for the game itself  I have to say I've been very invested in it since I started playing. I've been enjoying the story  and I really like Aloy as the protagonist. The combat is fun and can be very intense  but I do also appreciate the fact that stealth and setting traps is also a big part of the gameplay. Not to mention the world itself is beautiful and HUGE. I'm really looking forward to continuing the story and exploring the rest of the map  as right now at 14 hours in I haven't even explored half of the map yet  let alone the expansion.

I could definitely expand on this review  but for right now I just wanted to get a recommended review out since I'm enjoying it so much. Well worth the price for me.",1609258441,1609258441,True,3,0,0.525065958499908447,0,True,False,False,,

The tropes of Sony ""western"" RPGs are strongly reflected in the game and it doesn't do anything revolutionary - it stays in the safe lane to deliver what it needs  and it pays off in a game that's easy to get into. 

Excellent Port overall - had no issues with running the game and playing with KBM. Some weird frame drops in some areas but nothing game breaking. On a i5 7600k and a 1080ti  I can achieve 60FPS 80% of the time on a 1600p Ultrawide. Settings set at Original (medium)  running Textures and Models on High  turning off motion blur and AA (unnecessary at higher resolutions).

I also run this on my second PC  which has an i5 8600k and a 1080  hooked to a 1080p projector. Runs on default Favour Quality (High) at mostly steady 60fps.

 In general  if you're like me and enjoy Open World RPGs  then this is a must get on a Sale. Games/series you would also enjoy would be Witcher 3  RDR2  Assassin's Creed  Tomb Raider  Batman  Middle-Earth  Fall Out 3 - 4  Elder Scrolls  Borderlands  Far Cry  Bioshock (less open)  Dishonored (less open).",1609553949,1609554727,True,3,0,0.524735093116760254,0,True,False,False,,

[b]Negatives.[/b]

Occasionally there's some stuttering  but it's been minor.  Rarely the game seems to freeze or pause for a fraction of a second.  It's only happened a couple times in 14 hours and hasn't really been a problem  it's just annoying.

Once in a while when using the scan ability the effects that usually pop up simply fail to appear.  It doesn't really affect gameplay and it always corrects itself in a few seconds  but it's like the game just forgets to render it once in a while.

There are a few little things that could be improved.  You collect a lot of loot but some has no use other than to sell to a trader but there is no ""sell all junk"" option.  You have to go through your inventory to find each of these items every time.  It's not a big deal but a sell all treasure/junk button would be nice.  Or just auto sell it because it's not used for anything else. 

A shader optimization starts every single time you boot up the game that takes an insanely long time.  It does speed up load times  but you don't have to wait for it and in my opinion it's not really worth waiting up to 10 minutes or more for it every time you start up the game.

I ran into one glitch where a small  weak enemy got stuck in a rock but I was still able to kill it when it moved to a certain spot.  Climbing and jumping doesn't quite work the way you'd expect all the time.  I've fallen a few times when it was clear that the character should have jumped on to a post  or other surface.  It's not always obvious what you can climb  and sometimes you can't climb some things that would actually be easier than some of the things you can climb.

[b]The good stuff.[/b]

Crafting is quick and easy  especially making ammo since you can craft it from the radial menu where you select weapons.

Looting doesn't take too long like it can in some games.  The looting animation is short  and there's a loot all button.

Combat is fun and there are a lot of ways to go about taking down enemies.  You can run in firing arrows and attacking with your spear or take a stealthy approach to pick off one enemy at a time.  You can use traps and distractions.  You can switch weapons quickly in combat and when switching weapons there is a a bullet time mechanic  time slows significantly when you bring up the radial weapon menu.  You can also unlock abilities that let you slow time while aiming ranged weapons in different situations such as while jumping  sliding  or simply aiming normally.  There are precision and area effect weapons  weapons and traps that burn  freeze  electrocute  or even rend more parts off some of the enemies.  Most weapons have multiple ammo types and swapping on the fly is quite easy.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you aren't careful  but it's not too hard to get away from most enemies.

There's a decent size skill tree in the game and early on you can focus on gathering  melee  ranged combat  stealth takedowns  and a few other things.  As you level you get tougher but also get a point to spend on skills.  Higher tier skills cost more  and all skills above the first rank of skills have prerequisite skills.  It's possible to carry several types of weapons  armour  traps  and utility items such as healing and resistance potions early in the game and as you expand your storage space you can eventually carry a lot more.  This is important as you progress because different weapons and armour are better in some situations and against some enemies.

Overall the GUI is well made and easy to use.  The menu system works well and looks good.  The graphics  sound  music  animation  and overall look of the game is all great.  I notice little things here and there  like a few hairs out of place on the main character or the slight scar on one NPC's forehead  a character whose chin wrinkles as she speaks or another who tends to smile a lot.  These little things add a lot to the game.  The voice acting is generally good  too  and there is a lot of spoken dialogue.  So far I've found the story fairly interesting  if a tad predictable.

There are a lot of difficulty settings  and also aim assist that you can toggle  so if you just want to enjoy the story or want combat to be challenging (or nigh-impossible) then you can adjust it accordingly.

Otherwise  the game will take control of your character  move you to a different scene  and you will loose all loot from unlooted bodies/chests/plants/objects on the ground. The game rewards you for searching for items everywhere  but steals your opportunities if you chat with a plot based NPC  loot a boss's body  or move forward to a quest destination. At least I don't have to worry about losing quest opportunities by not using all dialog options.

I am tired of games that find it ok to  take away your gear  take control of your character  leave you in the open to be attacked  forcefully move your character in a battle scene to be a open target  and otherwise work against you.

The character you play is slow  complains too much  is weak  cannot dodge attacks  rolls faster on the ground than she can run  her father is weak  the character is unrealistic  and the entire tribe claims to be about survival but is not. I don't believe in the philosophy of the tribe  am tired of the tribe ripping the player character a new hole  providing no support  showing no respect  and not even caring to live. The plot hole of the tribe surviving a full on tribal attack is apparently forced upon you as no one claimed to hide.

I love the mechanics  but must say one more thing. How can you not get annoyed with a NPC constantly yelling  ""I'm over here...over here...over here...come save me...someone come save me...I'm over here...I'm over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here..."" I find myself saving the game just so I can practice eliminating the annoying NPCs just to find they are invincible. The NPC yells and no creature/monster can see them. I stand on the same platform where the NPC was at  stand up  and creatures shoot at me. At the very least  can the NPC whisper or waive me down. The programmers treat the player as incompetent to play the game when they must give constant verbal notification of where the NPC is located. This has driven me angry at the game.

Also you cannot assign hotkeys to your quickslot so you have to cycle through them in combat which is very bad in fast pasted action.

The Game itself is great. Story and Characters are great  Sound is great  the World looks amazing. The open Map gives you enough quests and things to find or to collect. The game understands to give you enough highquality content without getting to repetative or annoying. It is just the right amount of everything before you would get bored. So thumbs up for keeping the balance and keeping things interesting.

The Monster fights and combats can be pretty though  but would be a lot of easier with better controls. Sometimes you just stuck in animations  dont find the right weapon or item in time  get stuck on some environment prop. Also some weapons seem pretty redundant to me. 

All in all  this is a very good game. If they work on the controls and inventory a bit this could be an outstanding game.

After finishing the game (and the expansion) I can also say that the difficulty scales quite nicely.  I never felt like the game was too easy  even maxed out at level 60 with all skills  the best weapons  the best armor  etc etc.  Every encounter still required me to remember where weak points were  to shoot with precision  and to use the right elemental attacks if possible.  I was still encouraged to use stealth  and it never got old.  This is about as flawless as an open sandbox game can be...unlike Assassin's Creed Odyssey  which was just genuinely boring.

Bow Combat is Similar to The Witcher and Warframes (Slow mow while falling or jumping.) Very awesome and handy. The optional prep with focus such as marking all the enemies so you can keep track of them in cobat feels kinda like using binoculars in Ghost Recon: Wildlands.

Basically  my friends told me it was like tomb raider  which I have never played  but what I consider similar in play-style is like.. assassin's creed  or maybe even something like.. Well I don't know  it's like assassin's creed to me. But different. I mean there is the element of stealth that you have to have in order to kind of survive to get around the world  like sneaking so you don't use up all of your medicine pouch  which can be a pain in the butt to refill. But then there has been one straight up fight with like a mini-boss and a semi-boss  not sure what an actual boss looks like in this game. The first one is like.. it will wreck your crap if you don't kill it stealthily  the second one  there is no stealth in order to win  it's a straight up fight  and you gotta dodge roll  and run  until you can get some shots on it. Overall  I would rate it a 8/10 as far as gameplay and mechanics  but story-telling it is like a 9/10  I would give it a 10  but like sometimes when it is telling the story it doesn't explain some things  and if you gives you a lot of options for speech  and I would really recommend using them to get the whole picture of the story.

They nailed this game. If I had to pick a favorite game right now  it would be this one.

The open world feels a lot more open than it does in most ""open-world"" games and characters are fleshed out and interesting to converse with. The combat requires you to utilize a few different weapon types to serve very unique purposes in order to take down everything from small to enormous machines. This combined with the excellent sound and visual effects  along with the use of weak spots and specific machine parts that can be damaged or knocked off to affect the machines in different ways makes the combat feel very satisfying. All I will say about the story here is that it is very original and that you should avoid learning anything about it before you play because the way it unfolds is masterful.

I completed the main storyline in 38 hours - though you could spend more or less time depending on how you play  your skill level  and the difficulty setting you choose. I played fairly leisurely and spent time doing some of HZD's exceptionally well made side quests but I also pushed ahead in the main story in long bursts because of how interesting it was. I will definitely be playing past the main story.

The good:
- Beautiful game
- Interesting story (so far) and lore
- Smooth controls
- What was said above

The meh:
- Fighting is sometimes tiring: some enemies are sinks of hit points and the 3 ways to fight I found so far are not quite satisfying:
 * (arrow  arrow  dodge  dodge) × repeat 50 times
 * (dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  hit) × repeat until you get somewhat hit and change to another strategy

The story is SUCH an interesting concept  It had me hooked from the beginning. And the characters are very interesting. I just wanted to find out more  get more answers. I couldn't stop playing  and I can't wait for Horizon 2.

The combat system is one of the best I've ever experienced in a game  I really can't put it into words but you feel so much in control  you can do really cool kills and it really feels like you're the one doing it. Not like other games where you press a button and the whole epic kill becomes an animation that does the job for you.

The crafting system is not too simple / dumb  and not too hard either as some games that requires you to have 10 different pieces just to make one single arrow. (which get annoying after a while with thousands of pieces in your inventory) I feel this had a great balance to it.

What i don't like:
- Good lore but the story itself is not so much. But the ending is good so there's that. 
- It feels empty without good soundtracks
- Aside from Aloy other characters pretty much forgettable
- Facial animation is bad

I'm a sucker for story driven games with interesting lore (I read the fuck out of every lore entry in games) and this game delivers on that and much more. The combat and enemies are so much more engaging than nearly every other game like it out there. Seriously  every time you meet a new enemy all you think is 'holy shit'. And the progression is insane  enemies who you first think are super hard later get easy when you figure out how to beat them and at that point you're fighting machines way scarier than you could ever have imagined. It's awesome. And it's really cool that stealth is quite viable for the most part  it feels so good when you take down a bunch of machines with stealth successfully. 

And the graphics in this game just blew me away. It's a game made in 2017 for PS4 and yet to me the PC port looks like a game made in 2020(I ran it on max settings at 1080p). The environments are just absolutely stunning  you'll keep wanting to take photos with photo mode at every step of the way. The lighting and clouds especially give everything such an awe-inspiring feeling.

The story was great too  I usually love female protagonists and this game writes Aloy really well in my opinion. The things she goes through and her search for the truth give you a lot of respect and appreciation for the character. She's a badass for sure but she still has complexity and heartfelt moments to her that make her very memorable. 

To sum up  this game has an amazing world and lore  robot dinosaurs  dynamic combat that actually makes you switch things up instead of just spamming projectiles and a visually stunning environment even though the game is 3 years old. If you like any of these things at all you won't be disappointed. I tend to give up games super quick or don't finish them -  AC Odyssey  Valhalla  Witcher 3 and Skyrim are all games I liked for a while but got bored of eventually. This game wasn't one of those though. The story length is also just perfect if you're like me and get bored easily. I'm grateful they ported this over to PC or I'd never have played it.

It is all the more astonishing because the game screws up so much: 
The progress of the abilities  which you unlock  are messed up as if by design (“You want to hit harder with your spear? Good  then you have to eat dirt and unlock two bow abilities first.”)
But the main screw ups are the characters and the dialogues. Though the premise of the game world is interesting  the main story line is a bit awkward and the characters are  even for a computer game  incredibly flat and unbelievable. A girl who has spent her whole life with one person in the wilderness  is always cocky  self-assured and better informed about everything than everyone else and is also better at everything than everybody else. A king who just lost his lover to a torturer and who – so we are made to believe up to this point – is not a shallow person  immediately falls for our heroine. It is an obvious problem that computer games which want to appeal to broad player base have to do a lot of wish fulfillment. Good games succeed in hiding the sickening sweetness of this day dreaming by wrapping it in a realistic setting  showing the character developing their skills over time. But in Horizon this progress has happened before we start to play the main part of the game. Even worse  all other characters just exist in order to feed in these delusions of grandeur. In some way  this game puts you into the mind of a narcissistic sociopath  who not only wants to feel “I am the most attractive and strongest and …’”  but needs to be reassured about this constantly by everyone else: from a random passerby to the king (and who cares about character consistency  right?). Depressingly enough  the game designers of Horizon Zero Dawn seem to believe that the prototypical player of their game is such a narcissist that he/she will take the sweet pill without any bitter coating.
So if you can ignore all these dialogues with their cringy appeal to you self-love (stuff like ‘When I met you  I thought I am the older and more experienced but now I see…’ or ‘you have discovered in a very short time more than I have in decades’ and many more)  there are some really good fights waiting for you there.",1609512202,1609513710,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,,

There is a good story with a strong delivery  likable characters and strong acting from the casts. I really  really like Aloy as the main character as she is witty  strong  smart  and so much fun to play as. The world building is also great. How the landscape is portrayed is just beautiful. I keep wanting for more content  bigger world  but then  if the world is bigger but the content is sparse  it won't be as enjoyable. I don't know.

Gameplay is also enjoyable and a lot of fun. There are many paths to take in term of how you approach a situation. Whether you come blazing  shooting arrows in an action movie style  or you can just take it quietly  using stealth  dispatching your adversaries one by one and taking your time patiently. If anything I feel lacking is the melee combat. I feel it can be enriched further variety-wise. But overall  gameplay is amazing.

Music and ambience supports the adventure greatly  imho. When you just run around in the field  the approach of enemies  the tense tunes of the heated battles are all just beautiful. Never I felt music or sounds out of place or out of pace. 

Again  there are problems. Technical problems like crashing  or texture not loading properly (my character suddenly didn't have a body when I equipped the shield weave a couple of times)  and other problems you can find in the forums. It's not a perfect game  but if you ask me whether I enjoy it  the answer is yes  very much.

The story is pretty good from what I've seen so far. Cutscenes are actually interesting and I don't skip through them  like with some other games. In addition to the main quest line  there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy. Most of them have been simple but fun.

Combat is nice. Keep in mind that this is not a game where you can go all out against multiple enemies at once. This is a surefire way to end up dead. You can take on maybe one or two enemies at a time but the best strategy is to use ranged combat. Aloy has a variety of bows and tripwire-type traps at her disposal and it would behoove you to learn how to use them all. Aloy has the tools in her arsenal  so why not put them all to good use; the game gives you plenty of opportunity to do so. Either way  plan out your encounters and make the most of the weapons and terrain.

Exploration is also fun. The world is varied and rich. I find myself wandering about and constantly looking around in amazement at how beautiful the world is. If you have the appropriate hardware  crank this game up to max and let your jaw hit the floor.

That said  performance-wise  HZD seems to run great. Whatever bugs there were at launch have been fixed and the game runs smooth as butter on my system. I am running a 3700X  3080  16GB 3600 RAM and have the game installed on a 1TB 970 Evo Plus. I usually let the game run on my TV (LG CX 55"") and with everything at max settings and 4K  I average between 70-80 FPS. At 1440p  I get between 90-110. As stated  there have been no hiccups and the game runs smooth as butter.

All in all  my experience has been great. I can turn HZD on and before I know it  hours have passed and I have to force myself to turn the computer off. Coming from someone who was on the fence  I can only say to try this game out.

This game is breathtaking  in many ways  but mostly in art style/ visuals and story line. The characters you meet feel quite realistic in their personalities and the story is a nice blend of many fitting ingredients; futuristic and historic at the same time. A downside is maybe a bit too much religious superstition  but it fits the story pretty well. Also it is clearly a game developed in the first place for console. This is visible in the movement/fighting controls of the main character which can feel a bit clunky sometimes. And the insane loading time of 2 5 minutes in the start menu (while it's installed on my M2 SSD) was very awkward  but after running the optimization and a few more restarts it's now much better.

As it is  there is too much fighting  not enough peaceful lore and interaction for my tastes. To narrate Aloy (the main protagonist of the game): Just a few minutes of quiet. Usually that quiet doesn't last for minutes  if I don't try to be stealthy.

Since there is a constant need to gather resources  confrontations are unavoidable.

The Cauldrons are weird places  especially if considering they should have been built by modern technology standards.

Someties new machines appearing randomy still irritates me.

Upgraded my PC to 16GB RAM and it helped a lot. Very seldom loading lags after it and quitting the game went from a minute to a few seconds. 

I really enjoy the visuals while ""rappling down"" a cliff.

Lo que en un principio fué un horrible port con muchos fallos gráficos y técnicos (perdí un save como de 8hrs después de que un NPC no apareció para continuar una misión)  terminó siendo una experiencia muy buena. Al principio  el juego me iba entre 30 y 40fps en medium settings  pero después del parche 1.05 ya me comenzó a ir a 60fps estables en altos  al menos un 95% del tiempo.

La historia es bastante interesante  la música es buena (sólo si me aburrió de a madres la música en el mapa/menú)  el doblaje de voz en español latino es muy bueno (aunque yo lo jugué en inglés  el lip sync es muy bueno)  el gameplay es bastante sencillo pero divertido y el sistema de inventario  skill tree  crafting y demás es bastante robusto y muy fácil cuando se le agarra la onda. En general  lo recomiendo.

PRO:
+Los gráficos: Corre muy bien con una 1660Ti  i5 9300H y 16Gb RAM desde un SSD.
+El doblaje en español latino: Empieza muy bien (escuchando a Rubén Moya)  pero en inglés considero que es mejor.
+El mapa es muy grande y hay muchas cosas por hacer/coleccionar.
+La duración: Te lo puedes aventar en unas 20horas si solo vas por la historia principal  aunque yo me aventé 50+ porque también jugué misiones secundarias y el DLC.
+El DLC: Te da bastantes horas de juego  mayor dificultad y muchos niveles de experiencia. Está integrado totalmente al juego como una misión secundaria.
+La historia: Al principio da flojera  pero ya para el final si te quedas con ganas de que ya salga el 2 (y obvio que tenga su port en PC).
+El precio: El precio es super competitivo y por la cantidad de horas de juego que te da  es un gran deal.

CONTRAS:
-El filtro anisotrópico NO sirve
-El DLC está como una misión secundaria mas  por lo que es confuso si se debe hacer antes de terminar el juego  o después  o en qué momento. Yo recomiendo hacerlo cuando ya se tenga un nivel 35 o bien  omitirlo si solo se quiere hacer la historia principal porque si son bastantes horas de juego (6-10).
-El sistema de inventario: Se llena de mucha porquería que no sabes si utilizarás mas adelante o no  es medio molesto tener que estar eliminando cosas.
-Muchísimo coleccionable (es bueno o malo según tu punto de vista).
-Al juego le hace falta un gancho tipo Far Cry Primal con la opción de poder subir rápidamente montañas en lugar de tener que estar rodeando todo.

En general  muy recomendable si te gustan juegos tipo Far Cry  AC (mas o menos como Odyssey) y un combate similar a la nueva trilogía de Tomb Raider (obvio sin pistolas  puro arco).",1609864325,1609864325,True,1,1,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False,,

Fun game overall  the world building is where this game shines don't expect too much from the combat  story or the characters too much.
1. Combat is alright but can be tedious or just annoying especially if you don't take advantage of using your focus to see weak points and its specially tedious at the higher difficulties and in the frozen wilds but can be fun if you learn weak points and attack patterns  (which aren't all that complicated a bit one dimensional)  but that's just the combats with the machines which can be summed up as pretty much 'Fun when learned but somewhat tedious and just a bit annoying at higher difficulties' it isn't that challenging even at the hardest difficulties if I'm honest. Though that is what i can say about combat with machines  combat with humans in this game pretty much sucks ass  grunts are almost always a single head shot and down (though there are some exceptions later on) but the 'boss' mobs are needlessly tanky  spear play against humans is terrible as well  for some reason they are like are all like immovable objects when hit by spear power attacks and yet you can knock over machines which would weigh hundreds of kilos or even tonnes and yet these 80 - 100 kg humans just phase tank that crap. 
2. The base game Story is pretty predictable and the only good stuff I can say about the story is the world building that comes with it  I won't spoil it but its just fun learning about why the world ended up this way and all the stuff surrounding it. The side missions don't add much either except maybe interacting with characters you could probably go through the the game without doing the side missions and you wouldn't have an experience much different from someone who has except for maybe levels  the first few hours spear upgrade  the hunters lodge weapons and the cauldron overrides.
2.5. The DLC Story is pretty well done and enjoyable especially doing it just before the final mission. Some of the enemies in this dlc though pretty much sum up up my tedious and annoying feelings on combat especially the final machine introduced  the additional world buildings is really good and introduces some information/concept which may become a focus in the next game.
3. Characters in this game are well NPCs  I know that seems dumb and obvious but well that's the best description I can really offer  there wasn't much depth to characters without you actively trying to find it in going through  all the dialog but the main side characters weren't all that interesting beyond like 3 of them  while the side missions with them had some fun moments they were pretty forgettable as characters. Aloy as much as I enjoyed playing as her was sometimes jarring to watch play through a cut scene because it felt like there her character wasn't consistent sometimes but overall i think shes an interesting character with some interesting stuff behind her (could put it better but I don't want to spoil story stuff). The additional lore side characters you find out about during the story were pretty interesting especially in the context of what was happening back with them. The main DLC characters were interesting added to the overall experience and I can't really say much about the beyond they were pretty average good characters some of the side character from the side quests were interesting but didn't really stick.
3.5 This point is probably one of if not the biggest gripe/mild irritation with this game that brought me out of my immersion at points in the story because it felt really ham-fisted and a little forced at points. It was inserting modern politics into a world which has supposedly become more tribal / 'regressed' from todays societal norms. I can tell of a few examples without spoiling too much  one being at the start of the game where you meet with the envoy of a previously hostile tribes leader  the sun king  and during the conversation she asks if there is ever been a 'sun queen' and he says no and that begins a conversation which just make sense in the context of the world that is shown  two this probably isn't really to do with anything overt but every main antagonist in this game has been male  every single one and most of the important NPCs with power bar like 2 or 3 are women as well which doesn't make much sense outside her Nora tribe because there is lore reasons  I mean I have no problem with women with powerful positions in general but when the skew is so large in a game that has humans regressed to tribal societies and survival requires strength in 9/10 cases it doesn't make sense for all the powerful people to be women. But I think its worse in the context that every antagonist is male and pretty much all the side characters you meet all have a women in their lives they view as braver and stronger than them. I don't know it doesn't effect the game to a large degree and at some points I enjoyed it but at some points it was like being whiplashed out of my immersion and cringing at some of the things said and i think my biggest disappointment with this stuff was the missed opportunity of making Aloy a mold breaking character in this new tribal society and it could have worked but you can't break something that's been broken  multiple times  that's why my biggest gripe with this is instead of actually making Aloy influence the breaking of the mold they instead pretended there is a mold to break while patting Aloy on the back for breaking the mold.
Conclusion:
Ultimately I think this a game worth a try because the overall story with all the world building is the best I've seen in a long time and the characters do have their moments. The visuals are really well done and exploring while a chore at times is one of this games charm points and the music that accompanies it is great as well and is hard to fault. While it was a bit buggy here and there there wasn't anything major and only crashed once in the second last mission when loading an area I pressed a lot of buttons at the same time. Probably going in my top 10 which may seem strange from the score and the way I went on in the section above but well while I said all that it isn't that bad and isn't noticeable outside of times it feels off putting it nicely  the score went down due to just a lot of inconvenient stuff that is in the game which all have to due with combat  exploration and item storage and the fact that a lot of the hours you get out of this game just seem padded out in the form of exploration and collecting with the side quest not really offering to much beyond track this or kill that but yeah. I hope this was helpful  I'm mainly doing this out of venting mostly and wanting to put my impressions down somewhere well I hope you enjoy the game if you do get as I really think its worth playing through at least once.",1609574412,1609574412,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False,,

The player character  Aloy  must go on a quest to investigate the origin of the machines and the fall of the previous civilization.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Along her journey  Aloy will fight against machines and Human bandits. The design of the machines is really cool. Their appearance and behaviour is similar to animals such as horses  cows  tigers  bulls  crabs  crocodiles  hawks  or dinosaurs like the velociraptor  brontosaurus and t-rex. As well as melee attacks  some of them have laser weapons mounted on their back  or can spam fire or frost projectiles at you  and one machine even has a cloaking device.

•	Most bandits are armed with axe or bow  but their leaders have powerful heavy weapons like a minigun or grenade launcher  which you can pick up and use until they run out of ammo.

•	Aloy can wield a staff for melee attacks and various different types of bows which can shoot arrows enhanced with elemental damage. Fire does extra damage over time  frost will slow enemy movement and increase damage taken  while shock will stun them for a few seconds leaving them vulnerable to a critical melee attack. There’s also a really useful skill which lets you load up two or three arrows to fire simultaneously with any bow.

•	There’s a strong focus on using stealth  hiding in long grass to sneak past groups of powerful enemies  or getting close enough to perform a melee takedown on weaker enemies.

•	Combat can be quite tactical. One of my favourite weapons  the Tripcaster  lets you place explosive or shock tripwires on the ground  which will detonate when a machine runs over them. Before the start of a fight  I liked to place a few tripwires in strategic locations  between trees or rocks  then I’d stand with the tripwires between myself and the machines  shooting the machines with arrows while trying to lure them into charging through the tripwires.

•	Some machines have weak points that can be targeted to deal extra damage  or you can destroy their weapon components to reduce their threat to you  although this can be tricky when fighting against fast moving or flying enemies. Its actually easier when fighting bosses because of their huge size and slower movement.

•	You can unlock the ability to override machines to make them fight each other  or to use them as a mount to travel around the world quicker. I didn’t use mounts often because I quickly discovered that this will draw aggro from lots of nearby enemies (similar to driving a car in a Far Cry game)  so its less stressful to just sneak around on foot.

•	You can buy several outfits from traders which change Aloy’s appearance. Weapons and outfits can be upgraded with modifications which provide bonuses to various damage types  damage resistances  or stealth.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is very well written with an interesting sense of mystery  and I enjoyed slowly piecing together what happened in the old world. The conflict between Humans and machines has similarities to the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix.

•	Most side quests have unique stories which are of a similar quality level to those in Witcher 3  and much better than the copy and paste tasks usually found in open world games. Sometimes you’ll wander across machines and Humans fighting each other  while clearing bandit camps will allow friendly tribes to move in. All of these elements help to bring the world to life.

•	Voice acting is fantastic  especially Ashly Burch (who previously voiced Chloe in Life is Strange) as Aloy and Lance Reddick (Fringe  Quantum Break) who plays an important supporting character.

•	Lip syncing during cutscenes is the best I’ve seen since Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	The environment looks fantastic  from the forests  rivers and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

•	I had a smooth framerate during combat with machines and while exploring the world. The only significant problems I encountered were around a few bandit camps where my framerate dipped into the 40s  I’m assuming this was caused by columns of smoke because I didn’t see them anywhere else. I had some minor framerate drops in large settlements of NPCs  which wasn’t the end of the world because it didn’t affect any fast paced gameplay.

•	It took me 61 hours to complete the main quest  expansion  and lots of side quests. During this time I only crashed twice  so the game was very stable for me. Both crashes occurred before the release of patch 1.06 so it seems that whatever was causing the problem has been fixed.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

•	The camera has a mind of its own  sometimes changing position by itself. By default  Aloy will be slightly offset to the left of screen  like most third person games. However  there are times when the camera drifts so that Aloy is almost all the way to the right of the screen  which feels slightly disorienting. Its not an issue that makes the game unplayable  because you can immediately reset the camera position by aiming the bow. This also means its not a problem during combat because you’ll almost always be aiming. Its just a really strange design decision that doesn’t serve any purpose  and I can’t think of any other game I’ve played in the last few years where I’ve felt like I’m fighting the camera.

Combat and story are both excellent and while there are some technical flaws  they aren’t big enough reasons to avoid playing.

No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft  etc). 

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now  it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad  but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

And Aloy has same energy like reboot version of Lara Croft. Blitzing through their enemies primarily with a bow and arrow and still can win no matter how strong their enemies are. So Lovely. Make me interested in Archery even more.

[h1]Detailed Review :[/h1]
[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God  no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  VMProtect  etc ( Again  take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches  for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly  but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting  etc.

[b]Informational :[/b]
- Because I said earlier ""this game is not too complex""  so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

I really want to recommend this game. I do. It is an absolute masterpiece and I loved playing it… on the PS4. On PC this game is nearly unplayable unless you have only the top of the line hardware or willing to play one of the most beautiful games of the last generation on settings that make it look like minecraft. It barely hits 60fps with major graphical downgrades for me and I have a 2070 Super FTW3 card. The stuttering  the huge 20-30fps drops in places  the nearly 15 minutes you have to wait for shaders to load EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. It’s a mess. Now  will I remove my review if the Devs fix these issues? Absolutely. That hand will flip to a thumbs up and I will get to write a review about the gameplay itself. But  as it stands  you might be better off picking this game up on the PS4/5. And that pains me to say as a proud member of PCMR.

--Edit as of 11/27/20--
The dev is proving to be committed to this game and is patching it at a fast pace. Some issues have been fixed but many more remain. FPS is still very jittery and can rip you right out of the experience. While there is improvement  it might be many more months till this is what I consider playable.

--Edit as of 12/04/20--
I have 100% this game now  and let me tell you it was much easier on the PS4. The game would crash at the worst times and the frame lag would make some battles more about where  could I lure the enemy where I could get a smoother framerate rather than just trying to take down the enemy. A 40+ frame drop at the wrong time could mean having to reload a save.

I will say the 1.08 patch DID help with many of the issues  it just isn't enough though the devs are making great improvements. While I can not endorse this game as is  I highly suspect that will change in the future.

At that point  you're just ranting because you're mad that things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.

Edit: And enough to play through NG+ on Ultra Hard to get the last of the achievements ;)

If youve ever wanted to play Far Creed: Phantom Breath of the Wild Hunt Raiders Redemption  now is your chance. HZD plays like a mashup of all those games - which is both good and bad. 

Whats the bad? Almost everything can be compared to those other games  and the comparisons are frequently ""its almost as good as X but not quite"". Eg take the horse riding - it doesnt seem as good as RDR2  BOTW  or TW3  its not nearly as fluid or helpful  and instead I feel as though most of the time Im fighting a giant robot machine for control - which maybe I am. Which is a shame since you will end up spending so much time on horseback.

Whats the good? Being a blend of  and being compared to a bunch of superb games is quite an accomplishment. Combat  movement  economy  progression  ai  crafting  music  artwork  etc etc etc are all very good. 

Whats excellent? Stealth. Rocks  whistling  grass and telegraphed and forgiving AI all come together really well. I think the music and artwork are excellent  and I love the theme of the world - natural beauty and giant robot dinosaurs with laser breath! ""Squee!"" :)
 
Whats ""new"" in HZD then? Shooting giant dinosaurs with a variety of weapons to strip them of components+abilities  and to inflict status effects on them (maybe this is like Monster Hunter  but I havent played any of those). Hence the combat is a bit more cerebral than all of the games mentioned above. Anything else  anything else...? No? (Im sure if anyone reads this  someone will point out other novel stuff  but I cant remember it now).

Whats ""terrible"" (IMO): A large class of monster attacks knock Aloy to the ground/knock her back. This would be fine except a large class of Aloys attacks need to ""charge up"" (eg drawing the bow to max strength)  and so you have to frequently interrupt this  either by voluntarily rolling out of the way  or by getting hit and knocked down which also interrupts it. Some of Aloy's attacks (eg strong melee) cant be interrupted by rolling  so you'll just get knocked down. When you pick up heavy weapons  if you roll you drop them  so you have to pick them up again after. Its all very tiresome. The last time I recall being this annoyed by knockdown combat is Prototype (where the tank attacks would knock you about  stun locking you - to be clear though that was worse).

The writing is mixed: The overall story is an excellent concept  novel to me  and I really enjoyed it. The exposition through the world  text and speech  for key plot moments is superb  and backed my beautiful  haunting  fitting music  standout vs all the games Ive played in recent history and almost tear jerking. But most of it is incredibly forgettable filler stuff - fine to read/listen to  fine to ignore - but then again its hard to imagine a game with ~100 hours of play time with every written line being at the peak of the art form. The dialogue with characters can be skipped (with space) which is a blessing because while its not terrible  its fully generic and you cant make any choices of consequence - you cant make any choices at all IIRC  and hence there are no consequences for your actions  which is pretty bad for an RPG (ok  maybe there are some minor choices which involves getting a band of companions together  but this is super shallow).

There are a decent number of sidequests  errands (other side quests...?)  in addition to the main quests - Ive completed almost all of them now  but it never felt overwhelming (unlike eg the Far Creeds nearly infinite set of things to do on the map). Its quite nice having a game with such little filler. One gripe relates to the weapon tutorials - they dont progress unless you have the tutorial quest actively selected - but you can ignore them so thats fine.

Another major gripe is that just like the majority of the writing is forgettable  bland  generic and ultimately a bit pointless  so the same is true for the world map - its very pretty  but there is little point in ""exploration"" as an activity since when you get ""there""  there is nothing there. There is one ""secret special"" area of the game where if you collect a bunch of stuff during the main missions  by 90% through the game you can get a ""literally game changing"" set of armour (its not a secret though  its got a map marker and a quest associated with it...). This is in contrast to eg gothic where unique weapons could be found through random and persistent exploration all throughout the game but they were all totally missable if you didnt explore - I think it is a missed opportunity that there arent another 10-20 optional unique items which can be found purely through exploration - having this would add ""exploration"" as an extra dimension to the gameplay. I think if ~50% of the skill tree had been replaced by ""exploration found items"" the game would have felt more meaningful (or alternately if exploration found items were needed to unlock 50% of the skill tree).

All in all  I enjoyed HZD  even with its rough edges  and I would happily play a sequel (on PC). What core changes would I want to see in that?
- Choices that matter (dialogue and action)
- More ""cyber"" abilities in addition to the late game armour which dramatically mix up the gameplay  ala DX or Crysis3  discovered through the world.
- Less ""crap  med  good  great bow""  and more discovery of unique old world weapons. (More variety  less progression).
- Much less knock-down attacks  or much shorter ""build"" times for your attacks.
- Get rid of the inventory limits  managing those are a chore not a pleasure.
- A constant companion we can become attached to - horse  dog  cat  bird whatever. ""Dial a random horse"" is functional  but a missed emotional opportunity. Also  a permanent horse could be used for carrying excess inventory  necessitate fixing and upgrading  etc etc etc - all missed opportunities in HZD.
- An inventory ""wheel""  like the weapon wheel.
- Probably some more stuff  but this review is long enough already. :)",1609486204,1609741958,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False,,

Whatever performance issues there were in the past  it seems the Guerrilla team has resolved it.

[b][u]Game Review[/u][/b]
The open world landscape is picturesque and makes you want to use photo mode a lot. Combat is solid and makes you feel like a hunter. I really liked the progression of how the story unfolded. Voice acting and character animations during character interactions were good. Although I felt that in scenes that called for sadness that dealt with death/grief  both of those aspects were very mediocre and never sold it for me. You do see an improvement in character animations in the Frozen Wilds DLC though. I give it my ""Must Play"" stamp.",1609989211,1610005530,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since the release on Play Station and seeing how good of a game it was (drawing lots of inspiration from Witcher)  watching various streamers playing it  I hoped it would come to PC too  but since Guerilla Games only made Play Station exclusives I wasn't expecting any. So I was excited to play it on PC when it was actually announced to come to PC. The disappointment was big though when not only people reported lots of trouble playing it  but on top of that all  on my system for some reason it was not even able to start up at all. So I had to ask for a refund.

Now about half a year later  I've given it a second try and purchased it again and updated the copy I had still on my system. Setting the graphical setting one step above Original and it seem to run pretty fine still on my ye old system  and so far not run into any real bugs or glitches yet in the couple hours I played.

By far one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever created. I've been collecting dust and nothing else since it released on PS4 in February of 2017. When it released on PC this year in 2020  I shook off the grime and Steam slapped my ass with a fresh matte coat and told me [i]""get ready for a four day bender""[/i] as I emptied my wallet. Little did Steam know I got more than my money's worth. I didn't just get a game. I got one of the best.

[b]Port to PC[/b]
PS4 to PC was done right by this one. The controls feel right  there's no clunky-ness or re-adjustments needed. Only setting I've ever altered was the FOV cause the camera felt a little off. Majority of the negative reviews are people complaining that they can't get it to run. It works fine  you just need a good build to do it. Know why? Because this game was actually ported right and they made it look amazing on Ultra.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments— astounding. Hell  I'd take one as a wallpaper and put it up in my house. Framed. Maybe get it from one of those metal poster people. Real nice. I'm not gonna lie  you're gonna question your gravitational pull with all the hair clipping into keyframes. And I've only witnessed Aloy's model reaching up to the heavens one time  so let's just say model glitches are minimal.

[b]Story[/b]
Writers— pay raise when? They did a fucking fantastic job  that's putting it lightly. It's so [i]surreal[/i] how down to Earth it is; How emotionally invested you get in the main character. How intrigued you get through each step in the plot ladder. How their take on what such a world would be like is actually understandable (trying to avoid spoilers here). Damn  even some of the side quests hit you like a fucking red light runner. By the end of the game— if you've done everything  majority of the cast has gone through character development. And once you've seen it all. . . it tugs on your heartstrings man.
But if you don't give a damn about the story  you'll definitely enjoy the

[b]Combat[/b]
Bows and arrows aren't the only thing Aloy is known for. I'm gonna have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Depending on what you're fighting  it goes from 0-100 real quick and then it's all about strategy and acting fast. You have a wide variety of ways to handle a fight. It doesn't hand-hold you through them either. You gotta learn what you can use against your targets by yourself. Read the Notebook to memorize weaknesses. Use those invis frames you get from dodge rolls  don't be afraid to give up that fully charged shot in favor of getting the hell out of the way. The easier difficulty  the more disinterested you'll be in combat. Do yourself a favor in whip that baby up  just save Ultra Hard for New Game+.

[b]Overall[/b]
Horizon's a damn good game. Yes  there's times when Aloy goes blind and misses the platforming jump. And yes  there's some slight vibe kills when the model makes the wrong expression or when all of the sudden you're stuck inside of a rock hearing combat music.
But these are [i]small[/i] issues. Small! There's definitely other weird bugs that have been noticed by other people. But what's a video game without some these days?
Good outways the bad too much on this one.

Firstly  because the PC port had a very rough launch and there are still complaints of issues popping up from time to time. Secondly  because I wasn't sure if the idea of fighting robots would really be that enjoyable past a few hours or less.

Well  regarding the first concern  it seems they've done  good job at patching this up and getting it into a more playable state. I'm about 20 hours into the game now and I've yet to encounter a single bug or crash. The worst I have seen is a floating bush or piece of scenery here and there  and such things are really rare. I'm not sure if my hardware has anything to do with my lack of issues  so I will say that I'm using an RX 5700 8GB  16GB of RAM  and an AMD Ryzen 3600.

Regarding the second concern - this is where I think the game has done a great job. You are a very young hunter armed with only a few traps  bows  and a spear  going up against massive technologically advanced robots that look like they could topple entire buildings. I think the way the game handles this bizarre juxtaposition is pretty clever. If you run head-on at enemy machines with your spear swingin'  you will almost certainly die - especially at higher difficulties (there are many  including New Game+). Even if you vastly outlevel the enemy  this tactic will still get you beat up pretty good. The key to survival and victory is to handle each enemy on a case-by-case basis and to learn and know their strengths and weaknesses. From using specialised arrows to bust off parts of the robots or using fire to set their fuel stores alight - the way you take these mechanical beasts done is both satisfying and entertaining. Especially when they collapse to the ground with a gratifying thump of jingling parts and sparks. You can attack the machines from a more aggressive angle  dancing around them while strategically damaging them enough to kill them  or you can move in the shadows and thin the herd one-by-one through target analysis and well placed spear jabs. Combat is fast  hectic  and the bigger bots can take off 3/4 of your health in a single swipe of their metal claws or jaws.

As for the other usual stuff: Graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is astounding. Everything on Aloy's body has physics applied  from her hair down to the small beads that hang from her bow. She shivers when it's cold and complains when she has water in her boots. Her movement is entirely terrain-dependant and she will interact with foliage when moving through the world. I find this sort of thing important in a game where you will be spending hours looking at a character through a third-person perspective. I'm not sure what my frame rate is as I'm not running a FPS counter when I play  but I'd say it's floating around 60 with everything but AA and shadows maxed. They have improved the performance with patches but apparently this game is a system hog  so if you have lower specs you might want to make sure you stay within your 2-hour return window just in case.

The sound and music are good  although I will say that I wish the audio quality on voice lines was higher. You can tell that the audio is compressed and not mastered as good as everything else. It's a minor complaint and it doesn't really detract from the rest of the game  but it is noteworthy.

One last thing I wanted to note. The game has a fast travel system but it requires resources  which I think is awesome. You need to craft travel packs that have things for your travel such as meat and materials. Seems like a great way of having a fast travel system while avoiding the teleport-everywhere issue that Skyrim had.",1609608111,1609608111,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,,

It's not a perfect port  however  as I still experience the occasional crash  but it seems well improved from when it was first released to PC  as they are continuing to release patches.

The tropes of Sony ""western"" RPGs are strongly reflected in the game and it doesn't do anything revolutionary - it stays in the safe lane to deliver what it needs  and it pays off in a game that's easy to get into. 

Excellent Port overall - had no issues with running the game and playing with KBM. Some weird frame drops in some areas but nothing game breaking. On a i5 7600k and a 1080ti  I can achieve 60FPS 80% of the time on a 1600p Ultrawide. Settings set at Original (medium)  running Textures and Models on High  turning off motion blur and AA (unnecessary at higher resolutions).

I also run this on my second PC  which has an i5 8600k and a 1080  hooked to a 1080p projector. Runs on default Favour Quality (High) at mostly steady 60fps.

 In general  if you're like me and enjoy Open World RPGs  then this is a must get on a Sale. Games/series you would also enjoy would be Witcher 3  RDR2  Assassin's Creed  Tomb Raider  Batman  Middle-Earth  Fall Out 3 - 4  Elder Scrolls  Borderlands  Far Cry  Bioshock (less open)  Dishonored (less open).",1609553949,1609554727,True,3,0,0.524735093116760254,0,True,False,False,,

[b]Negatives.[/b]

Occasionally there's some stuttering  but it's been minor.  Rarely the game seems to freeze or pause for a fraction of a second.  It's only happened a couple times in 14 hours and hasn't really been a problem  it's just annoying.

Once in a while when using the scan ability the effects that usually pop up simply fail to appear.  It doesn't really affect gameplay and it always corrects itself in a few seconds  but it's like the game just forgets to render it once in a while.

There are a few little things that could be improved.  You collect a lot of loot but some has no use other than to sell to a trader but there is no ""sell all junk"" option.  You have to go through your inventory to find each of these items every time.  It's not a big deal but a sell all treasure/junk button would be nice.  Or just auto sell it because it's not used for anything else. 

A shader optimization starts every single time you boot up the game that takes an insanely long time.  It does speed up load times  but you don't have to wait for it and in my opinion it's not really worth waiting up to 10 minutes or more for it every time you start up the game.

I ran into one glitch where a small  weak enemy got stuck in a rock but I was still able to kill it when it moved to a certain spot.  Climbing and jumping doesn't quite work the way you'd expect all the time.  I've fallen a few times when it was clear that the character should have jumped on to a post  or other surface.  It's not always obvious what you can climb  and sometimes you can't climb some things that would actually be easier than some of the things you can climb.

[b]The good stuff.[/b]

Crafting is quick and easy  especially making ammo since you can craft it from the radial menu where you select weapons.

Looting doesn't take too long like it can in some games.  The looting animation is short  and there's a loot all button.

Combat is fun and there are a lot of ways to go about taking down enemies.  You can run in firing arrows and attacking with your spear or take a stealthy approach to pick off one enemy at a time.  You can use traps and distractions.  You can switch weapons quickly in combat and when switching weapons there is a a bullet time mechanic  time slows significantly when you bring up the radial weapon menu.  You can also unlock abilities that let you slow time while aiming ranged weapons in different situations such as while jumping  sliding  or simply aiming normally.  There are precision and area effect weapons  weapons and traps that burn  freeze  electrocute  or even rend more parts off some of the enemies.  Most weapons have multiple ammo types and swapping on the fly is quite easy.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you aren't careful  but it's not too hard to get away from most enemies.

There's a decent size skill tree in the game and early on you can focus on gathering  melee  ranged combat  stealth takedowns  and a few other things.  As you level you get tougher but also get a point to spend on skills.  Higher tier skills cost more  and all skills above the first rank of skills have prerequisite skills.  It's possible to carry several types of weapons  armour  traps  and utility items such as healing and resistance potions early in the game and as you expand your storage space you can eventually carry a lot more.  This is important as you progress because different weapons and armour are better in some situations and against some enemies.

Overall the GUI is well made and easy to use.  The menu system works well and looks good.  The graphics  sound  music  animation  and overall look of the game is all great.  I notice little things here and there  like a few hairs out of place on the main character or the slight scar on one NPC's forehead  a character whose chin wrinkles as she speaks or another who tends to smile a lot.  These little things add a lot to the game.  The voice acting is generally good  too  and there is a lot of spoken dialogue.  So far I've found the story fairly interesting  if a tad predictable.

There are a lot of difficulty settings  and also aim assist that you can toggle  so if you just want to enjoy the story or want combat to be challenging (or nigh-impossible) then you can adjust it accordingly.

Otherwise  the game will take control of your character  move you to a different scene  and you will loose all loot from unlooted bodies/chests/plants/objects on the ground. The game rewards you for searching for items everywhere  but steals your opportunities if you chat with a plot based NPC  loot a boss's body  or move forward to a quest destination. At least I don't have to worry about losing quest opportunities by not using all dialog options.

I am tired of games that find it ok to  take away your gear  take control of your character  leave you in the open to be attacked  forcefully move your character in a battle scene to be a open target  and otherwise work against you.

The character you play is slow  complains too much  is weak  cannot dodge attacks  rolls faster on the ground than she can run  her father is weak  the character is unrealistic  and the entire tribe claims to be about survival but is not. I don't believe in the philosophy of the tribe  am tired of the tribe ripping the player character a new hole  providing no support  showing no respect  and not even caring to live. The plot hole of the tribe surviving a full on tribal attack is apparently forced upon you as no one claimed to hide.

I love the mechanics  but must say one more thing. How can you not get annoyed with a NPC constantly yelling  ""I'm over here...over here...over here...come save me...someone come save me...I'm over here...I'm over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here..."" I find myself saving the game just so I can practice eliminating the annoying NPCs just to find they are invincible. The NPC yells and no creature/monster can see them. I stand on the same platform where the NPC was at  stand up  and creatures shoot at me. At the very least  can the NPC whisper or waive me down. The programmers treat the player as incompetent to play the game when they must give constant verbal notification of where the NPC is located. This has driven me angry at the game.

The controls are taken over pretty good and you can play with mouse and keyboard  but you cannot hide the face that the whole game was build upon playing with a Controller. So the gameplay  inventory and combat mechanic are feeling a little bit uncomfortably when playing with mouse and keyboard. Also you cannot assign hotkeys to your quickslot so you have to cycle through them in combat which is very bad in fast pasted action.

The Game itself is great. Story and Characters are great  Sound is great  the World looks amazing. The open Map gives you enough quests and things to find or to collect. The game understands to give you enough highquality content without getting to repetative or annoying. It is just the right amount of everything before you would get bored. So thumbs up for keeping the balance and keeping things interesting.

The Monster fights and combats can be pretty though  but would be a lot of easier with better controls. Sometimes you just stuck in animations  dont find the right weapon or item in time  get stuck on some environment prop. Also some weapons seem pretty redundant to me. 

All in all  this is a very good game. If they work on the controls and inventory a bit this could be an outstanding game.

After finishing the game (and the expansion) I can also say that the difficulty scales quite nicely.

I was still encouraged to use stealth  and it never got old.  This is about as flawless as an open sandbox game can be...unlike Assassin's Creed Odyssey  which was just genuinely boring.

Aloy reacts with such clear responsivity to the controls that it's a pleasure to just watch her climb  explore  shoot  etc.  The graphics are phenomenal and I honestly can't recommend this game enough.",1609571488,1610221178,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,,

I think the only minor con I can think of so far is that the graphics settings was set a bit too high for my Nvidia 1080 so the cool intro sequence was a bit laggy running it at 1440p.

   As for the game itself they did a really nice job. They combined the best things of quite a few games that i have played in the past and then added more.The world is gorgeous great looking graphics. This  as well as the atmosphere  feels like Assassins Creed and Skyrim with a bit of The Witcher in my opinion. Movement (especially mount riding and climbing) as well as Melee attacks feel a lot like Assassins Creed. (with some fun additions)... Bow Combat is Similar to The Witcher and Warframes (Slow mow while falling or jumping.) Very awesome and handy. The optional prep with focus such as marking all the enemies so you can keep track of them in cobat feels kinda like using binoculars in Ghost Recon: Wildlands. As for the Crafting it is very simple yet crucial  so you will have arrows and potions and such.

Basically  my friends told me it was like tomb raider  which I have never played  but what I consider similar in play-style is like.. assassin's creed  or maybe even something like.. Well I don't know  it's like assassin's creed to me. But different. I mean there is the element of stealth that you have to have in order to kind of survive to get around the world  like sneaking so you don't use up all of your medicine pouch  which can be a pain in the butt to refill. But then there has been one straight up fight with like a mini-boss and a semi-boss  not sure what an actual boss looks like in this game. The first one is like.. it will wreck your crap if you don't kill it stealthily  the second one  there is no stealth in order to win  it's a straight up fight  and you gotta dodge roll  and run  until you can get some shots on it. Overall  I would rate it a 8/10 as far as gameplay and mechanics  but story-telling it is like a 9/10  I would give it a 10  but like sometimes when it is telling the story it doesn't explain some things  and if you gives you a lot of options for speech  and I would really recommend using them to get the whole picture of the story. The environment and idea of the world to me is 10/10  very original  very fun  very immersive  beautifully designed  and graphics are breathtaking.

They nailed this game. If I had to pick a favorite game right now  it would be this one.

The open world feels a lot more open than it does in most ""open-world"" games and characters are fleshed out and interesting to converse with. The combat requires you to utilize a few different weapon types to serve very unique purposes in order to take down everything from small to enormous machines. This combined with the excellent sound and visual effects  along with the use of weak spots and specific machine parts that can be damaged or knocked off to affect the machines in different ways makes the combat feel very satisfying. All I will say about the story here is that it is very original and that you should avoid learning anything about it before you play because the way it unfolds is masterful.

I completed the main storyline in 38 hours - though you could spend more or less time depending on how you play  your skill level  and the difficulty setting you choose. I played fairly leisurely and spent time doing some of HZD's exceptionally well made side quests but I also pushed ahead in the main story in long bursts because of how interesting it was. I will definitely be playing past the main story.

The good:
- Beautiful game
- Interesting story (so far) and lore
- Smooth controls
- What was said above

The meh:
- Fighting is sometimes tiring: some enemies are sinks of hit points and the 3 ways to fight I found so far are not quite satisfying:
 * (arrow  arrow  dodge  dodge) × repeat 50 times
 * (dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  hit) × repeat until you get somewhat hit and change to another strategy
 * (stealth  stealth strike  flee) × repeat 4  5 times per enemy (the quickest strategy I found  except with flying enemies… f*ck dem flying enemies)
I understand that it is important to hit weak part of the enemy  but it is not always that easy… (Ok  I know  git gud  all that)
- There are too much crafting and upgrading materials
- I am using a custom keyboard configuration  but I can't rebind keys to match my configuration (some keys are locked…) And before you roar at me  I CAN'T play with a controller…

The story is SUCH an interesting concept  It had me hooked from the beginning. And the characters are very interesting. I just wanted to find out more  get more answers. I couldn't stop playing  and I can't wait for Horizon 2.

The combat system is one of the best I've ever experienced in a game  I really can't put it into words but you feel so much in control  you can do really cool kills and it really feels like you're the one doing it. Not like other games where you press a button and the whole epic kill becomes an animation that does the job for you.

The crafting system is not too simple / dumb  and not too hard either as some games that requires you to have 10 different pieces just to make one single arrow. (which get annoying after a while with thousands of pieces in your inventory) I feel this had a great balance to it.

- Excellent combat  pretty good AI
- Ultra Hard difficulty is very fun
- Pretty graphics  especially the biomes and the machines

What i don't like:
- Good lore but the story itself is not so much. But the ending is good so there's that. 
- It feels empty without good soundtracks
- Aside from Aloy other characters pretty much forgettable
- Facial animation is bad

I'm a sucker for story driven games with interesting lore (I read the fuck out of every lore entry in games) and this game delivers on that and much more. The combat and enemies are so much more engaging than nearly every other game like it out there. Seriously  every time you meet a new enemy all you think is 'holy shit'. And the progression is insane  enemies who you first think are super hard later get easy when you figure out how to beat them and at that point you're fighting machines way scarier than you could ever have imagined. It's awesome. And it's really cool that stealth is quite viable for the most part  it feels so good when you take down a bunch of machines with stealth successfully. 

And the graphics in this game just blew me away. It's a game made in 2017 for PS4 and yet to me the PC port looks like a game made in 2020(I ran it on max settings at 1080p). The environments are just absolutely stunning  you'll keep wanting to take photos with photo mode at every step of the way. The lighting and clouds especially give everything such an awe-inspiring feeling.

The story was great too  I usually love female protagonists and this game writes Aloy really well in my opinion. The things she goes through and her search for the truth give you a lot of respect and appreciation for the character. She's a badass for sure but she still has complexity and heartfelt moments to her that make her very memorable. 

To sum up  this game has an amazing world and lore  robot dinosaurs  dynamic combat that actually makes you switch things up instead of just spamming projectiles and a visually stunning environment even though the game is 3 years old. If you like any of these things at all you won't be disappointed. I tend to give up games super quick or don't finish them -  AC Odyssey  Valhalla  Witcher 3 and Skyrim are all games I liked for a while but got bored of eventually. This game wasn't one of those though. The story length is also just perfect if you're like me and get bored easily. I'm grateful they ported this over to PC or I'd never have played it.

It is all the more astonishing because the game screws up so much: 
The progress of the abilities  which you unlock  are messed up as if by design (“You want to hit harder with your spear? Good  then you have to eat dirt and unlock two bow abilities first.”)
But the main screw ups are the characters and the dialogues. Though the premise of the game world is interesting  the main story line is a bit awkward and the characters are  even for a computer game  incredibly flat and unbelievable. A girl who has spent her whole life with one person in the wilderness  is always cocky  self-assured and better informed about everything than everyone else and is also better at everything than everybody else. A king who just lost his lover to a torturer and who – so we are made to believe up to this point – is not a shallow person  immediately falls for our heroine. It is an obvious problem that computer games which want to appeal to broad player base have to do a lot of wish fulfillment. Good games succeed in hiding the sickening sweetness of this day dreaming by wrapping it in a realistic setting  showing the character developing their skills over time. But in Horizon this progress has happened before we start to play the main part of the game. Even worse  all other characters just exist in order to feed in these delusions of grandeur. In some way  this game puts you into the mind of a narcissistic sociopath  who not only wants to feel “I am the most attractive and strongest and …’”  but needs to be reassured about this constantly by everyone else: from a random passerby to the king (and who cares about character consistency  right?). Depressingly enough  the game designers of Horizon Zero Dawn seem to believe that the prototypical player of their game is such a narcissist that he/she will take the sweet pill without any bitter coating.
So if you can ignore all these dialogues with their cringy appeal to you self-love (stuff like ‘When I met you  I thought I am the older and more experienced but now I see…’ or ‘you have discovered in a very short time more than I have in decades’ and many more)  there are some really good fights waiting for you there.",1609512202,1609513710,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,,

There is a good story with a strong delivery  likable characters and strong acting from the casts. I really  really like Aloy as the main character as she is witty  strong  smart  and so much fun to play as. The world building is also great. How the landscape is portrayed is just beautiful. I keep wanting for more content  bigger world  but then  if the world is bigger but the content is sparse  it won't be as enjoyable. I don't know.

Gameplay is also enjoyable and a lot of fun. There are many paths to take in term of how you approach a situation. Whether you come blazing  shooting arrows in an action movie style  or you can just take it quietly  using stealth  dispatching your adversaries one by one and taking your time patiently. If anything I feel lacking is the melee combat. I feel it can be enriched further variety-wise. But overall  gameplay is amazing.

Music and ambience supports the adventure greatly  imho. When you just run around in the field  the approach of enemies  the tense tunes of the heated battles are all just beautiful. Never I felt music or sounds out of place or out of pace. 

Again  there are problems. Technical problems like crashing  or texture not loading properly (my character suddenly didn't have a body when I equipped the shield weave a couple of times)  and other problems you can find in the forums. It's not a perfect game  but if you ask me whether I enjoy it  the answer is yes  very much.

Here is hoping that the sequel also comes to PC.

The story is pretty good from what I've seen so far. Cutscenes are actually interesting and I don't skip through them  like with some other games. In addition to the main quest line  there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy. Most of them have been simple but fun.

Combat is nice. Keep in mind that this is not a game where you can go all out against multiple enemies at once. This is a surefire way to end up dead. You can take on maybe one or two enemies at a time but the best strategy is to use ranged combat. Aloy has a variety of bows and tripwire-type traps at her disposal and it would behoove you to learn how to use them all. Aloy has the tools in her arsenal  so why not put them all to good use; the game gives you plenty of opportunity to do so. Either way  plan out your encounters and make the most of the weapons and terrain.

Exploration is also fun. The world is varied and rich. I find myself wandering about and constantly looking around in amazement at how beautiful the world is. If you have the appropriate hardware  crank this game up to max and let your jaw hit the floor.

That said  performance-wise  HZD seems to run great. Whatever bugs there were at launch have been fixed and the game runs smooth as butter on my system. I am running a 3700X  3080  16GB 3600 RAM and have the game installed on a 1TB 970 Evo Plus. I usually let the game run on my TV (LG CX 55"") and with everything at max settings and 4K  I average between 70-80 FPS. At 1440p  I get between 90-110. As stated  there have been no hiccups and the game runs smooth as butter.

All in all  my experience has been great. I can turn HZD on and before I know it  hours have passed and I have to force myself to turn the computer off. Coming from someone who was on the fence  I can only say to try this game out.

This game is breathtaking  in many ways  but mostly in art style/ visuals and story line. The characters you meet feel quite realistic in their personalities and the story is a nice blend of many fitting ingredients; futuristic and historic at the same time. A downside is maybe a bit too much religious superstition  but it fits the story pretty well. Also it is clearly a game developed in the first place for console. This is visible in the movement/fighting controls of the main character which can feel a bit clunky sometimes. And the insane loading time of 2 5 minutes in the start menu (while it's installed on my M2 SSD) was very awkward  but after running the optimization and a few more restarts it's now much better.

As it is  there is too much fighting  not enough peaceful lore and interaction for my tastes. To narrate Aloy (the main protagonist of the game): Just a few minutes of quiet. Usually that quiet doesn't last for minutes  if I don't try to be stealthy.

Since there is a constant need to gather resources  confrontations are unavoidable.

The Cauldrons are weird places  especially if considering they should have been built by modern technology standards.

Someties new machines appearing randomy still irritates me.

Upgraded my PC to 16GB RAM and it helped a lot. Very seldom loading lags after it and quitting the game went from a minute to a few seconds. 

I really enjoy the visuals while ""rappling down"" a cliff. 

I got the game when it was 1.08 so I have no technical issues. Although more weapon slots on a PC would be great.

Lo que en un principio fué un horrible port con muchos fallos gráficos y técnicos (perdí un save como de 8hrs después de que un NPC no apareció para continuar una misión)  terminó siendo una experiencia muy buena. Al principio  el juego me iba entre 30 y 40fps en medium settings  pero después del parche 1.05 ya me comenzó a ir a 60fps estables en altos  al menos un 95% del tiempo.

La historia es bastante interesante  la música es buena (sólo si me aburrió de a madres la música en el mapa/menú)  el doblaje de voz en español latino es muy bueno (aunque yo lo jugué en inglés  el lip sync es muy bueno)  el gameplay es bastante sencillo pero divertido y el sistema de inventario  skill tree  crafting y demás es bastante robusto y muy fácil cuando se le agarra la onda. En general  lo recomiendo.

PRO:
+Los gráficos: Corre muy bien con una 1660Ti  i5 9300H y 16Gb RAM desde un SSD.
+El doblaje en español latino: Empieza muy bien (escuchando a Rubén Moya)  pero en inglés considero que es mejor.
+El mapa es muy grande y hay muchas cosas por hacer/coleccionar.
+La duración: Te lo puedes aventar en unas 20horas si solo vas por la historia principal  aunque yo me aventé 50+ porque también jugué misiones secundarias y el DLC.
+El DLC: Te da bastantes horas de juego  mayor dificultad y muchos niveles de experiencia. Está integrado totalmente al juego como una misión secundaria.
+La historia: Al principio da flojera  pero ya para el final si te quedas con ganas de que ya salga el 2 (y obvio que tenga su port en PC).
+El precio: El precio es super competitivo y por la cantidad de horas de juego que te da  es un gran deal.

CONTRAS:
-El filtro anisotrópico NO sirve
-El DLC está como una misión secundaria mas  por lo que es confuso si se debe hacer antes de terminar el juego  o después  o en qué momento. Yo recomiendo hacerlo cuando ya se tenga un nivel 35 o bien  omitirlo si solo se quiere hacer la historia principal porque si son bastantes horas de juego (6-10).
-El sistema de inventario: Se llena de mucha porquería que no sabes si utilizarás mas adelante o no  es medio molesto tener que estar eliminando cosas.
-Muchísimo coleccionable (es bueno o malo según tu punto de vista).
-Al juego le hace falta un gancho tipo Far Cry Primal con la opción de poder subir rápidamente montañas en lugar de tener que estar rodeando todo.

En general  muy recomendable si te gustan juegos tipo Far Cry  AC (mas o menos como Odyssey) y un combate similar a la nueva trilogía de Tomb Raider (obvio sin pistolas  puro arco).",1609864325,1609864325,True,1,1,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False,,

Combat is alright but can be tedious or just annoying especially if you don't take advantage of using your focus to see weak points and its specially tedious at the higher difficulties and in the frozen wilds but can be fun if you learn weak points and attack patterns  (which aren't all that complicated a bit one dimensional)  but that's just the combats with the machines which can be summed up as pretty much 'Fun when learned but somewhat tedious and just a bit annoying at higher difficulties' it isn't that challenging even at the hardest difficulties if I'm honest. Though that is what i can say about combat with machines  combat with humans in this game pretty much sucks ass  grunts are almost always a single head shot and down (though there are some exceptions later on) but the 'boss' mobs are needlessly tanky  spear play against humans is terrible as well  for some reason they are like are all like immovable objects when hit by spear power attacks and yet you can knock over machines which would weigh hundreds of kilos or even tonnes and yet these 80 - 100 kg humans just phase tank that crap. 
2. The base game Story is pretty predictable and the only good stuff I can say about the story is the world building that comes with it  I won't spoil it but its just fun learning about why the world ended up this way and all the stuff surrounding it. The side missions don't add much either except maybe interacting with characters you could probably go through the the game without doing the side missions and you wouldn't have an experience much different from someone who has except for maybe levels  the first few hours spear upgrade  the hunters lodge weapons and the cauldron overrides.
2.5. The DLC Story is pretty well done and enjoyable especially doing it just before the final mission. Some of the enemies in this dlc though pretty much sum up up my tedious and annoying feelings on combat especially the final machine introduced  the additional world buildings is really good and introduces some information/concept which may become a focus in the next game.
3. Characters in this game are well NPCs  I know that seems dumb and obvious but well that's the best description I can really offer  there wasn't much depth to characters without you actively trying to find it in going through  all the dialog but the main side characters weren't all that interesting beyond like 3 of them  while the side missions with them had some fun moments they were pretty forgettable as characters. Aloy as much as I enjoyed playing as her was sometimes jarring to watch play through a cut scene because it felt like there her character wasn't consistent sometimes but overall i think shes an interesting character with some interesting stuff behind her (could put it better but I don't want to spoil story stuff). The additional lore side characters you find out about during the story were pretty interesting especially in the context of what was happening back with them. The main DLC characters were interesting added to the overall experience and I can't really say much about the beyond they were pretty average good characters some of the side character from the side quests were interesting but didn't really stick.
3.5 This point is probably one of if not the biggest gripe/mild irritation with this game that brought me out of my immersion at points in the story because it felt really ham-fisted and a little forced at points. It was inserting modern politics into a world which has supposedly become more tribal / 'regressed' from todays societal norms. I can tell of a few examples without spoiling too much  one being at the start of the game where you meet with the envoy of a previously hostile tribes leader  the sun king  and during the conversation she asks if there is ever been a 'sun queen' and he says no and that begins a conversation which just make sense in the context of the world that is shown  two this probably isn't really to do with anything overt but every main antagonist in this game has been male  every single one and most of the important NPCs with power bar like 2 or 3 are women as well which doesn't make much sense outside her Nora tribe because there is lore reasons  I mean I have no problem with women with powerful positions in general but when the skew is so large in a game that has humans regressed to tribal societies and survival requires strength in 9/10 cases it doesn't make sense for all the powerful people to be women. But I think its worse in the context that every antagonist is male and pretty much all the side characters you meet all have a women in their lives they view as braver and stronger than them. I don't know it doesn't effect the game to a large degree and at some points I enjoyed it but at some points it was like being whiplashed out of my immersion and cringing at some of the things said and i think my biggest disappointment with this stuff was the missed opportunity of making Aloy a mold breaking character in this new tribal society and it could have worked but you can't break something that's been broken  multiple times  that's why my biggest gripe with this is instead of actually making Aloy influence the breaking of the mold they instead pretended there is a mold to break while patting Aloy on the back for breaking the mold.
Conclusion:
Ultimately I think this a game worth a try because the overall story with all the world building is the best I've seen in a long time and the characters do have their moments. The visuals are really well done and exploring while a chore at times is one of this games charm points and the music that accompanies it is great as well and is hard to fault. While it was a bit buggy here and there there wasn't anything major and only crashed once in the second last mission when loading an area I pressed a lot of buttons at the same time. Probably going in my top 10 which may seem strange from the score and the way I went on in the section above but well while I said all that it isn't that bad and isn't noticeable outside of times it feels off putting it nicely  the score went down due to just a lot of inconvenient stuff that is in the game which all have to due with combat  exploration and item storage and the fact that a lot of the hours you get out of this game just seem padded out in the form of exploration and collecting with the side quest not really offering to much beyond track this or kill that but yeah. I hope this was helpful  I'm mainly doing this out of venting mostly and wanting to put my impressions down somewhere well I hope you enjoy the game if you do get as I really think its worth playing through at least once.",1609574412,1609574412,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False,,

The player character  Aloy  must go on a quest to investigate the origin of the machines and the fall of the previous civilization.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Along her journey  Aloy will fight against machines and Human bandits. The design of the machines is really cool. Their appearance and behaviour is similar to animals such as horses  cows  tigers  bulls  crabs  crocodiles  hawks  or dinosaurs like the velociraptor  brontosaurus and t-rex. As well as melee attacks  some of them have laser weapons mounted on their back  or can spam fire or frost projectiles at you  and one machine even has a cloaking device.

•	Most bandits are armed with axe or bow  but their leaders have powerful heavy weapons like a minigun or grenade launcher  which you can pick up and use until they run out of ammo.

•	Aloy can wield a staff for melee attacks and various different types of bows which can shoot arrows enhanced with elemental damage. Fire does extra damage over time  frost will slow enemy movement and increase damage taken  while shock will stun them for a few seconds leaving them vulnerable to a critical melee attack. There’s also a really useful skill which lets you load up two or three arrows to fire simultaneously with any bow.

•	There’s a strong focus on using stealth  hiding in long grass to sneak past groups of powerful enemies  or getting close enough to perform a melee takedown on weaker enemies.

•	Combat can be quite tactical. One of my favourite weapons  the Tripcaster  lets you place explosive or shock tripwires on the ground  which will detonate when a machine runs over them. Before the start of a fight  I liked to place a few tripwires in strategic locations  between trees or rocks  then I’d stand with the tripwires between myself and the machines  shooting the machines with arrows while trying to lure them into charging through the tripwires.

•	Some machines have weak points that can be targeted to deal extra damage  or you can destroy their weapon components to reduce their threat to you  although this can be tricky when fighting against fast moving or flying enemies. Its actually easier when fighting bosses because of their huge size and slower movement.

•	You can unlock the ability to override machines to make them fight each other  or to use them as a mount to travel around the world quicker. I didn’t use mounts often because I quickly discovered that this will draw aggro from lots of nearby enemies (similar to driving a car in a Far Cry game)  so its less stressful to just sneak around on foot.

•	You can buy several outfits from traders which change Aloy’s appearance. Weapons and outfits can be upgraded with modifications which provide bonuses to various damage types  damage resistances  or stealth.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is very well written with an interesting sense of mystery  and I enjoyed slowly piecing together what happened in the old world. The conflict between Humans and machines has similarities to the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix.

•	Most side quests have unique stories which are of a similar quality level to those in Witcher 3  and much better than the copy and paste tasks usually found in open world games. Sometimes you’ll wander across machines and Humans fighting each other  while clearing bandit camps will allow friendly tribes to move in. All of these elements help to bring the world to life.

•	Voice acting is fantastic  especially Ashly Burch (who previously voiced Chloe in Life is Strange) as Aloy and Lance Reddick (Fringe  Quantum Break) who plays an important supporting character.

•	Lip syncing during cutscenes is the best I’ve seen since Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	The environment looks fantastic  from the forests  rivers and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

•	I had a smooth framerate during combat with machines and while exploring the world. The only significant problems I encountered were around a few bandit camps where my framerate dipped into the 40s  I’m assuming this was caused by columns of smoke because I didn’t see them anywhere else. I had some minor framerate drops in large settlements of NPCs  which wasn’t the end of the world because it didn’t affect any fast paced gameplay.

•	It took me 61 hours to complete the main quest  expansion  and lots of side quests. During this time I only crashed twice  so the game was very stable for me. Both crashes occurred before the release of patch 1.06 so it seems that whatever was causing the problem has been fixed.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

•	The camera has a mind of its own  sometimes changing position by itself. By default  Aloy will be slightly offset to the left of screen  like most third person games. However  there are times when the camera drifts so that Aloy is almost all the way to the right of the screen  which feels slightly disorienting. Its not an issue that makes the game unplayable  because you can immediately reset the camera position by aiming the bow. This also means its not a problem during combat because you’ll almost always be aiming. Its just a really strange design decision that doesn’t serve any purpose  and I can’t think of any other game I’ve played in the last few years where I’ve felt like I’m fighting the camera.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game and I rate it as an absolute must play for action game fans. Combat and story are both excellent and while there are some technical flaws  they aren’t big enough reasons to avoid playing.

For a game that classified as an ""RPG"" game  this game is not too complex. So anyone can hop in and enjoying the game  the scenery  and the story. No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft  etc). 

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now  it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad  but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

And Aloy has same energy like reboot version of Lara Croft. Blitzing through their enemies primarily with a bow and arrow and still can win no matter how strong their enemies are. So Lovely. Make me interested in Archery even more.

[h1]Detailed Review :[/h1]
[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God  no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  VMProtect  etc ( Again  take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches  for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly  but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting  etc.

[b]Informational :[/b]
- Because I said earlier ""this game is not too complex""  so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

I really want to recommend this game. I do. It is an absolute masterpiece and I loved playing it… on the PS4. On PC this game is nearly unplayable unless you have only the top of the line hardware or willing to play one of the most beautiful games of the last generation on settings that make it look like minecraft. It barely hits 60fps with major graphical downgrades for me and I have a 2070 Super FTW3 card. The stuttering  the huge 20-30fps drops in places  the nearly 15 minutes you have to wait for shaders to load EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. It’s a mess. Now  will I remove my review if the Devs fix these issues? Absolutely. That hand will flip to a thumbs up and I will get to write a review about the gameplay itself. But  as it stands  you might be better off picking this game up on the PS4/5. And that pains me to say as a proud member of PCMR.

--Edit as of 11/27/20--
The dev is proving to be committed to this game and is patching it at a fast pace. Some issues have been fixed but many more remain. FPS is still very jittery and can rip you right out of the experience. While there is improvement  it might be many more months till this is what I consider playable.

--Edit as of 12/04/20--
I have 100% this game now  and let me tell you it was much easier on the PS4. The game would crash at the worst times and the frame lag would make some battles more about where  could I lure the enemy where I could get a smoother framerate rather than just trying to take down the enemy. A 40+ frame drop at the wrong time could mean having to reload a save.

I will say the 1.08 patch DID help with many of the issues  it just isn't enough though the devs are making great improvements. While I can not endorse this game as is  I highly suspect that will change in the future.

At that point  you're just ranting because you're mad that things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.

Edit: And enough to play through NG+ on Ultra Hard to get the last of the achievements ;)

If youve ever wanted to play Far Creed: Phantom Breath of the Wild Hunt Raiders Redemption  now is your chance. HZD plays like a mashup of all those games - which is both good and bad. 

Whats the bad? Almost everything can be compared to those other games  and the comparisons are frequently ""its almost as good as X but not quite"". Eg take the horse riding - it doesnt seem as good as RDR2  BOTW  or TW3  its not nearly as fluid or helpful  and instead I feel as though most of the time Im fighting a giant robot machine for control - which maybe I am. Which is a shame since you will end up spending so much time on horseback.

Whats the good? Being a blend of  and being compared to a bunch of superb games is quite an accomplishment. Combat  movement  economy  progression  ai  crafting  music  artwork  etc etc etc are all very good. 

Whats excellent? Stealth. Rocks  whistling  grass and telegraphed and forgiving AI all come together really well. I think the music and artwork are excellent  and I love the theme of the world - natural beauty and giant robot dinosaurs with laser breath! ""Squee!"" :)
 
Whats ""new"" in HZD then? Shooting giant dinosaurs with a variety of weapons to strip them of components+abilities  and to inflict status effects on them (maybe this is like Monster Hunter  but I havent played any of those). Hence the combat is a bit more cerebral than all of the games mentioned above. Anything else  anything else...? No? (Im sure if anyone reads this  someone will point out other novel stuff  but I cant remember it now).

Whats ""terrible"" (IMO): A large class of monster attacks knock Aloy to the ground/knock her back. This would be fine except a large class of Aloys attacks need to ""charge up"" (eg drawing the bow to max strength)  and so you have to frequently interrupt this  either by voluntarily rolling out of the way  or by getting hit and knocked down which also interrupts it. Some of Aloy's attacks (eg strong melee) cant be interrupted by rolling  so you'll just get knocked down. When you pick up heavy weapons  if you roll you drop them  so you have to pick them up again after. Its all very tiresome. The last time I recall being this annoyed by knockdown combat is Prototype (where the tank attacks would knock you about  stun locking you - to be clear though that was worse).

The writing is mixed: The overall story is an excellent concept  novel to me  and I really enjoyed it. The exposition through the world  text and speech  for key plot moments is superb  and backed my beautiful  haunting  fitting music  standout vs all the games Ive played in recent history and almost tear jerking. But most of it is incredibly forgettable filler stuff - fine to read/listen to  fine to ignore - but then again its hard to imagine a game with ~100 hours of play time with every written line being at the peak of the art form. The dialogue with characters can be skipped (with space) which is a blessing because while its not terrible  its fully generic and you cant make any choices of consequence - you cant make any choices at all IIRC  and hence there are no consequences for your actions  which is pretty bad for an RPG (ok  maybe there are some minor choices which involves getting a band of companions together  but this is super shallow).

There are a decent number of sidequests  errands (other side quests...?)  in addition to the main quests - Ive completed almost all of them now  but it never felt overwhelming (unlike eg the Far Creeds nearly infinite set of things to do on the map). Its quite nice having a game with such little filler. One gripe relates to the weapon tutorials - they dont progress unless you have the tutorial quest actively selected - but you can ignore them so thats fine.

Another major gripe is that just like the majority of the writing is forgettable  bland  generic and ultimately a bit pointless  so the same is true for the world map - its very pretty  but there is little point in ""exploration"" as an activity since when you get ""there""  there is nothing there. There is one ""secret special"" area of the game where if you collect a bunch of stuff during the main missions  by 90% through the game you can get a ""literally game changing"" set of armour (its not a secret though  its got a map marker and a quest associated with it...). This is in contrast to eg gothic where unique weapons could be found through random and persistent exploration all throughout the game but they were all totally missable if you didnt explore - I think it is a missed opportunity that there arent another 10-20 optional unique items which can be found purely through exploration - having this would add ""exploration"" as an extra dimension to the gameplay. I think if ~50% of the skill tree had been replaced by ""exploration found items"" the game would have felt more meaningful (or alternately if exploration found items were needed to unlock 50% of the skill tree).

All in all  I enjoyed HZD  even with its rough edges  and I would happily play a sequel (on PC). What core changes would I want to see in that?
- Choices that matter (dialogue and action)
- More ""cyber"" abilities in addition to the late game armour which dramatically mix up the gameplay  ala DX or Crysis3  discovered through the world.
- Less ""crap  med  good  great bow""  and more discovery of unique old world weapons. (More variety  less progression).
- Much less knock-down attacks  or much shorter ""build"" times for your attacks.
- Get rid of the inventory limits  managing those are a chore not a pleasure.
- A constant companion we can become attached to - horse  dog  cat  bird whatever. ""Dial a random horse"" is functional  but a missed emotional opportunity. Also  a permanent horse could be used for carrying excess inventory  necessitate fixing and upgrading  etc etc etc - all missed opportunities in HZD.
- An inventory ""wheel""  like the weapon wheel.
- Probably some more stuff  but this review is long enough already. :)",1609486204,1609741958,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False,,

I encountered one loading bug where I had to restart the game and one minor visual bug with foliage that cleared away after a short while in my 84 hours of playing the game (as of this writing). Whatever performance issues there were in the past  it seems the Guerrilla team has resolved it.

The open world landscape is picturesque and makes you want to use photo mode a lot. Combat is solid and makes you feel like a hunter. I really liked the progression of how the story unfolded. Voice acting and character animations during character interactions were good. Although I felt that in scenes that called for sadness that dealt with death/grief  both of those aspects were very mediocre and never sold it for me. You do see an improvement in character animations in the Frozen Wilds DLC though. I give it my ""Must Play"" stamp.",1609989211,1610005530,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,,

Ever since the release on Play Station and seeing how good of a game it was (drawing lots of inspiration from Witcher)  watching various streamers playing it  I hoped it would come to PC too  but since Guerilla Games only made Play Station exclusives I wasn't expecting any. So I was excited to play it on PC when it was actually announced to come to PC. The disappointment was big though when not only people reported lots of trouble playing it  but on top of that all  on my system for some reason it was not even able to start up at all. So I had to ask for a refund.

By far one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever created. I've been collecting dust and nothing else since it released on PS4 in February of 2017. When it released on PC this year in 2020  I shook off the grime and Steam slapped my ass with a fresh matte coat and told me [i]""get ready for a four day bender""[/i] as I emptied my wallet. Little did Steam know I got more than my money's worth. I didn't just get a game. I got one of the best.

[b]Port to PC[/b]
PS4 to PC was done right by this one. The controls feel right  there's no clunky-ness or re-adjustments needed. Only setting I've ever altered was the FOV cause the camera felt a little off. Majority of the negative reviews are people complaining that they can't get it to run. It works fine  you just need a good build to do it. Know why? Because this game was actually ported right and they made it look amazing on Ultra.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments— astounding. Hell  I'd take one as a wallpaper and put it up in my house. Framed. Maybe get it from one of those metal poster people. Real nice. I'm not gonna lie  you're gonna question your gravitational pull with all the hair clipping into keyframes. And I've only witnessed Aloy's model reaching up to the heavens one time  so let's just say model glitches are minimal.

[b]Story[/b]
Writers— pay raise when? They did a fucking fantastic job  that's putting it lightly. It's so [i]surreal[/i] how down to Earth it is; How emotionally invested you get in the main character. How intrigued you get through each step in the plot ladder. How their take on what such a world would be like is actually understandable (trying to avoid spoilers here). Damn  even some of the side quests hit you like a fucking red light runner. By the end of the game— if you've done everything  majority of the cast has gone through character development. And once you've seen it all. . . it tugs on your heartstrings man.
But if you don't give a damn about the story  you'll definitely enjoy the

[b]Combat[/b]
Bows and arrows aren't the only thing Aloy is known for. I'm gonna have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Depending on what you're fighting  it goes from 0-100 real quick and then it's all about strategy and acting fast. You have a wide variety of ways to handle a fight. It doesn't hand-hold you through them either. You gotta learn what you can use against your targets by yourself. Read the Notebook to memorize weaknesses. Use those invis frames you get from dodge rolls  don't be afraid to give up that fully charged shot in favor of getting the hell out of the way. The easier difficulty  the more disinterested you'll be in combat. Do yourself a favor in whip that baby up  just save Ultra Hard for New Game+.

[b]Overall[/b]
Horizon's a damn good game. Yes  there's times when Aloy goes blind and misses the platforming jump. And yes  there's some slight vibe kills when the model makes the wrong expression or when all of the sudden you're stuck inside of a rock hearing combat music.
But these are [i]small[/i] issues. Small! There's definitely other weird bugs that have been noticed by other people. But what's a video game without some these days?
Good outways the bad too much on this one.

Firstly  because the PC port had a very rough launch and there are still complaints of issues popping up from time to time. Secondly  because I wasn't sure if the idea of fighting robots would really be that enjoyable past a few hours or less.

Well  regarding the first concern  it seems they've done  good job at patching this up and getting it into a more playable state. I'm about 20 hours into the game now and I've yet to encounter a single bug or crash. The worst I have seen is a floating bush or piece of scenery here and there  and such things are really rare. I'm not sure if my hardware has anything to do with my lack of issues  so I will say that I'm using an RX 5700 8GB  16GB of RAM  and an AMD Ryzen 3600.

Regarding the second concern - this is where I think the game has done a great job. You are a very young hunter armed with only a few traps  bows  and a spear  going up against massive technologically advanced robots that look like they could topple entire buildings. I think the way the game handles this bizarre juxtaposition is pretty clever. If you run head-on at enemy machines with your spear swingin'  you will almost certainly die - especially at higher difficulties (there are many  including New Game+). Even if you vastly outlevel the enemy  this tactic will still get you beat up pretty good. The key to survival and victory is to handle each enemy on a case-by-case basis and to learn and know their strengths and weaknesses. From using specialised arrows to bust off parts of the robots or using fire to set their fuel stores alight - the way you take these mechanical beasts done is both satisfying and entertaining. Especially when they collapse to the ground with a gratifying thump of jingling parts and sparks. You can attack the machines from a more aggressive angle  dancing around them while strategically damaging them enough to kill them  or you can move in the shadows and thin the herd one-by-one through target analysis and well placed spear jabs. Combat is fast  hectic  and the bigger bots can take off 3/4 of your health in a single swipe of their metal claws or jaws.

As for the other usual stuff: Graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is astounding. Everything on Aloy's body has physics applied  from her hair down to the small beads that hang from her bow. She shivers when it's cold and complains when she has water in her boots. Her movement is entirely terrain-dependant and she will interact with foliage when moving through the world. I find this sort of thing important in a game where you will be spending hours looking at a character through a third-person perspective. I'm not sure what my frame rate is as I'm not running a FPS counter when I play  but I'd say it's floating around 60 with everything but AA and shadows maxed. They have improved the performance with patches but apparently this game is a system hog  so if you have lower specs you might want to make sure you stay within your 2-hour return window just in case.

The sound and music are good  although I will say that I wish the audio quality on voice lines was higher. You can tell that the audio is compressed and not mastered as good as everything else. It's a minor complaint and it doesn't really detract from the rest of the game  but it is noteworthy.

One last thing I wanted to note. The game has a fast travel system but it requires resources  which I think is awesome. You need to craft travel packs that have things for your travel such as meat and materials. Seems like a great way of having a fast travel system while avoiding the teleport-everywhere issue that Skyrim had.",1609608111,1609608111,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,,

It's not a perfect port  however  as I still experience the occasional crash  but it seems well improved from when it was first released to PC  as they are continuing to release patches.

On a i5 7600k and a 1080ti  I can achieve 60FPS 80% of the time on a 1600p Ultrawide. Settings set at Original (medium)  running Textures and Models on High  turning off motion blur and AA (unnecessary at higher resolutions).

I also run this on my second PC  which has an i5 8600k and a 1080  hooked to a 1080p projector. Runs on default Favour Quality (High) at mostly steady 60fps.

 In general  if you're like me and enjoy Open World RPGs  then this is a must get on a Sale. Games/series you would also enjoy would be Witcher 3  RDR2  Assassin's Creed  Tomb Raider  Batman  Middle-Earth  Fall Out 3 - 4  Elder Scrolls  Borderlands  Far Cry  Bioshock (less open)  Dishonored (less open).",1609553949,1609554727,True,3,0,0.524735093116760254,0,True,False,False,,

[b]Negatives.[/b]

Occasionally there's some stuttering  but it's been minor.  Rarely the game seems to freeze or pause for a fraction of a second.  It's only happened a couple times in 14 hours and hasn't really been a problem  it's just annoying.

Once in a while when using the scan ability the effects that usually pop up simply fail to appear.  It doesn't really affect gameplay and it always corrects itself in a few seconds  but it's like the game just forgets to render it once in a while.

There are a few little things that could be improved.  You collect a lot of loot but some has no use other than to sell to a trader but there is no ""sell all junk"" option.  You have to go through your inventory to find each of these items every time.  It's not a big deal but a sell all treasure/junk button would be nice.  Or just auto sell it because it's not used for anything else. 

A shader optimization starts every single time you boot up the game that takes an insanely long time.  It does speed up load times  but you don't have to wait for it and in my opinion it's not really worth waiting up to 10 minutes or more for it every time you start up the game.

I ran into one glitch where a small  weak enemy got stuck in a rock but I was still able to kill it when it moved to a certain spot.  Climbing and jumping doesn't quite work the way you'd expect all the time.  I've fallen a few times when it was clear that the character should have jumped on to a post  or other surface.  It's not always obvious what you can climb  and sometimes you can't climb some things that would actually be easier than some of the things you can climb.

[b]The good stuff.[/b]

Crafting is quick and easy  especially making ammo since you can craft it from the radial menu where you select weapons.

Looting doesn't take too long like it can in some games.  The looting animation is short  and there's a loot all button.

Combat is fun and there are a lot of ways to go about taking down enemies.  You can run in firing arrows and attacking with your spear or take a stealthy approach to pick off one enemy at a time.  You can use traps and distractions.  You can switch weapons quickly in combat and when switching weapons there is a a bullet time mechanic  time slows significantly when you bring up the radial weapon menu.  You can also unlock abilities that let you slow time while aiming ranged weapons in different situations such as while jumping  sliding  or simply aiming normally.  There are precision and area effect weapons  weapons and traps that burn  freeze  electrocute  or even rend more parts off some of the enemies.  Most weapons have multiple ammo types and swapping on the fly is quite easy.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you aren't careful  but it's not too hard to get away from most enemies.

There's a decent size skill tree in the game and early on you can focus on gathering  melee  ranged combat  stealth takedowns  and a few other things.  As you level you get tougher but also get a point to spend on skills.  Higher tier skills cost more  and all skills above the first rank of skills have prerequisite skills.  It's possible to carry several types of weapons  armour  traps  and utility items such as healing and resistance potions early in the game and as you expand your storage space you can eventually carry a lot more.  This is important as you progress because different weapons and armour are better in some situations and against some enemies.

Overall the GUI is well made and easy to use.  The menu system works well and looks good.  The graphics  sound  music  animation  and overall look of the game is all great.  I notice little things here and there  like a few hairs out of place on the main character or the slight scar on one NPC's forehead  a character whose chin wrinkles as she speaks or another who tends to smile a lot.  These little things add a lot to the game.  The voice acting is generally good  too  and there is a lot of spoken dialogue.  So far I've found the story fairly interesting  if a tad predictable.

There are a lot of difficulty settings  and also aim assist that you can toggle  so if you just want to enjoy the story or want combat to be challenging (or nigh-impossible) then you can adjust it accordingly.

Otherwise  the game will take control of your character  move you to a different scene  and you will loose all loot from unlooted bodies/chests/plants/objects on the ground. The game rewards you for searching for items everywhere  but steals your opportunities if you chat with a plot based NPC  loot a boss's body  or move forward to a quest destination. At least I don't have to worry about losing quest opportunities by not using all dialog options.

I am tired of games that find it ok to  take away your gear  take control of your character  leave you in the open to be attacked  forcefully move your character in a battle scene to be a open target  and otherwise work against you.

The character you play is slow  complains too much  is weak  cannot dodge attacks  rolls faster on the ground than she can run  her father is weak  the character is unrealistic  and the entire tribe claims to be about survival but is not. I don't believe in the philosophy of the tribe  am tired of the tribe ripping the player character a new hole  providing no support  showing no respect  and not even caring to live. The plot hole of the tribe surviving a full on tribal attack is apparently forced upon you as no one claimed to hide.

I love the mechanics  but must say one more thing. How can you not get annoyed with a NPC constantly yelling  ""I'm over here...over here...over here...come save me...someone come save me...I'm over here...I'm over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here..."" I find myself saving the game just so I can practice eliminating the annoying NPCs just to find they are invincible. The NPC yells and no creature/monster can see them. I stand on the same platform where the NPC was at  stand up  and creatures shoot at me. At the very least  can the NPC whisper or waive me down. The programmers treat the player as incompetent to play the game when they must give constant verbal notification of where the NPC is located. This has driven me angry at the game.

The controls are taken over pretty good and you can play with mouse and keyboard  but you cannot hide the face that the whole game was build upon playing with a Controller. So the gameplay  inventory and combat mechanic are feeling a little bit uncomfortably when playing with mouse and keyboard. Also you cannot assign hotkeys to your quickslot so you have to cycle through them in combat which is very bad in fast pasted action.

The Game itself is great. Story and Characters are great  Sound is great  the World looks amazing. The open Map gives you enough quests and things to find or to collect. The game understands to give you enough highquality content without getting to repetative or annoying. It is just the right amount of everything before you would get bored. So thumbs up for keeping the balance and keeping things interesting.

The Monster fights and combats can be pretty though  but would be a lot of easier with better controls. Sometimes you just stuck in animations  dont find the right weapon or item in time  get stuck on some environment prop. Also some weapons seem pretty redundant to me. 

All in all  this is a very good game. If they work on the controls and inventory a bit this could be an outstanding game.

After finishing the game (and the expansion) I can also say that the difficulty scales quite nicely.

They combined the best things of quite a few games that i have played in the past and then added more.The world is gorgeous great looking graphics. This  as well as the atmosphere  feels like Assassins Creed and Skyrim with a bit of The Witcher in my opinion. Movement (especially mount riding and climbing) as well as Melee attacks feel a lot like Assassins Creed. (with some fun additions)... Bow Combat is Similar to The Witcher and Warframes (Slow mow while falling or jumping.) Very awesome and handy. The optional prep with focus such as marking all the enemies so you can keep track of them in cobat feels kinda like using binoculars in Ghost Recon: Wildlands. As for the Crafting it is very simple yet crucial  so you will have arrows and potions and such.

Basically  my friends told me it was like tomb raider  which I have never played  but what I consider similar in play-style is like.. assassin's creed  or maybe even something like.. Well I don't know  it's like assassin's creed to me. But different. I mean there is the element of stealth that you have to have in order to kind of survive to get around the world  like sneaking so you don't use up all of your medicine pouch  which can be a pain in the butt to refill. But then there has been one straight up fight with like a mini-boss and a semi-boss  not sure what an actual boss looks like in this game. The first one is like.. it will wreck your crap if you don't kill it stealthily  the second one  there is no stealth in order to win  it's a straight up fight  and you gotta dodge roll  and run  until you can get some shots on it. Overall  I would rate it a 8/10 as far as gameplay and mechanics  but story-telling it is like a 9/10  I would give it a 10  but like sometimes when it is telling the story it doesn't explain some things  and if you gives you a lot of options for speech  and I would really recommend using them to get the whole picture of the story. The environment and idea of the world to me is 10/10  very original  very fun  very immersive  beautifully designed  and graphics are breathtaking.

They nailed this game. If I had to pick a favorite game right now  it would be this one.

The open world feels a lot more open than it does in most ""open-world"" games and characters are fleshed out and interesting to converse with. The combat requires you to utilize a few different weapon types to serve very unique purposes in order to take down everything from small to enormous machines. This combined with the excellent sound and visual effects  along with the use of weak spots and specific machine parts that can be damaged or knocked off to affect the machines in different ways makes the combat feel very satisfying. All I will say about the story here is that it is very original and that you should avoid learning anything about it before you play because the way it unfolds is masterful.

I completed the main storyline in 38 hours - though you could spend more or less time depending on how you play  your skill level  and the difficulty setting you choose. I played fairly leisurely and spent time doing some of HZD's exceptionally well made side quests but I also pushed ahead in the main story in long bursts because of how interesting it was. I will definitely be playing past the main story.

My computer has a Ryzen 7 3700X and an RTX 2060 and the game runs very smoothly at 1080p  even on ultra settings.

Since I like both those games  I can only recommand HZD.

The good:
- Beautiful game
- Interesting story (so far) and lore
- Smooth controls
- What was said above

The meh:
- Fighting is sometimes tiring: some enemies are sinks of hit points and the 3 ways to fight I found so far are not quite satisfying:
 * (arrow  arrow  dodge  dodge) × repeat 50 times
 * (dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  dodge  hit) × repeat until you get somewhat hit and change to another strategy
 * (stealth  stealth strike  flee) × repeat 4  5 times per enemy (the quickest strategy I found  except with flying enemies… f*ck dem flying enemies)
I understand that it is important to hit weak part of the enemy  but it is not always that easy… (Ok  I know  git gud  all that)
- There are too much crafting and upgrading materials
- I am using a custom keyboard configuration  but I can't rebind keys to match my configuration (some keys are locked…) And before you roar at me  I CAN'T play with a controller…

The story is SUCH an interesting concept  It had me hooked from the beginning. And the characters are very interesting. I just wanted to find out more  get more answers. I couldn't stop playing  and I can't wait for Horizon 2.

The combat system is one of the best I've ever experienced in a game  I really can't put it into words but you feel so much in control  you can do really cool kills and it really feels like you're the one doing it. Not like other games where you press a button and the whole epic kill becomes an animation that does the job for you.

The crafting system is not too simple / dumb  and not too hard either as some games that requires you to have 10 different pieces just to make one single arrow. (which get annoying after a while with thousands of pieces in your inventory) I feel this had a great balance to it.

- Excellent combat  pretty good AI
- Ultra Hard difficulty is very fun
- Pretty graphics  especially the biomes and the machines

What i don't like:
- Good lore but the story itself is not so much. But the ending is good so there's that. 
- It feels empty without good soundtracks
- Aside from Aloy other characters pretty much forgettable
- Facial animation is bad

I'm a sucker for story driven games with interesting lore (I read the fuck out of every lore entry in games) and this game delivers on that and much more. The combat and enemies are so much more engaging than nearly every other game like it out there. Seriously  every time you meet a new enemy all you think is 'holy shit'. And the progression is insane  enemies who you first think are super hard later get easy when you figure out how to beat them and at that point you're fighting machines way scarier than you could ever have imagined. It's awesome. And it's really cool that stealth is quite viable for the most part  it feels so good when you take down a bunch of machines with stealth successfully. 

And the graphics in this game just blew me away. It's a game made in 2017 for PS4 and yet to me the PC port looks like a game made in 2020(I ran it on max settings at 1080p). The environments are just absolutely stunning  you'll keep wanting to take photos with photo mode at every step of the way. The lighting and clouds especially give everything such an awe-inspiring feeling.

The story was great too  I usually love female protagonists and this game writes Aloy really well in my opinion. The things she goes through and her search for the truth give you a lot of respect and appreciation for the character. She's a badass for sure but she still has complexity and heartfelt moments to her that make her very memorable. 

To sum up  this game has an amazing world and lore  robot dinosaurs  dynamic combat that actually makes you switch things up instead of just spamming projectiles and a visually stunning environment even though the game is 3 years old. If you like any of these things at all you won't be disappointed. I tend to give up games super quick or don't finish them -  AC Odyssey  Valhalla  Witcher 3 and Skyrim are all games I liked for a while but got bored of eventually. This game wasn't one of those though. The story length is also just perfect if you're like me and get bored easily. I'm grateful they ported this over to PC or I'd never have played it.

It is all the more astonishing because the game screws up so much: 
The progress of the abilities  which you unlock  are messed up as if by design (“You want to hit harder with your spear? Good  then you have to eat dirt and unlock two bow abilities first.”)
But the main screw ups are the characters and the dialogues. Though the premise of the game world is interesting  the main story line is a bit awkward and the characters are  even for a computer game  incredibly flat and unbelievable. A girl who has spent her whole life with one person in the wilderness  is always cocky  self-assured and better informed about everything than everyone else and is also better at everything than everybody else. A king who just lost his lover to a torturer and who – so we are made to believe up to this point – is not a shallow person  immediately falls for our heroine. It is an obvious problem that computer games which want to appeal to broad player base have to do a lot of wish fulfillment. Good games succeed in hiding the sickening sweetness of this day dreaming by wrapping it in a realistic setting  showing the character developing their skills over time. But in Horizon this progress has happened before we start to play the main part of the game. Even worse  all other characters just exist in order to feed in these delusions of grandeur. In some way  this game puts you into the mind of a narcissistic sociopath  who not only wants to feel “I am the most attractive and strongest and …’”  but needs to be reassured about this constantly by everyone else: from a random passerby to the king (and who cares about character consistency  right?). Depressingly enough  the game designers of Horizon Zero Dawn seem to believe that the prototypical player of their game is such a narcissist that he/she will take the sweet pill without any bitter coating.
So if you can ignore all these dialogues with their cringy appeal to you self-love (stuff like ‘When I met you  I thought I am the older and more experienced but now I see…’ or ‘you have discovered in a very short time more than I have in decades’ and many more)  there are some really good fights waiting for you there.",1609512202,1609513710,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False,,

There is a good story with a strong delivery  likable characters and strong acting from the casts. I really  really like Aloy as the main character as she is witty  strong  smart  and so much fun to play as. The world building is also great. How the landscape is portrayed is just beautiful. I keep wanting for more content  bigger world  but then  if the world is bigger but the content is sparse  it won't be as enjoyable. I don't know.

Gameplay is also enjoyable and a lot of fun. There are many paths to take in term of how you approach a situation. Whether you come blazing  shooting arrows in an action movie style  or you can just take it quietly  using stealth  dispatching your adversaries one by one and taking your time patiently. If anything I feel lacking is the melee combat. I feel it can be enriched further variety-wise. But overall  gameplay is amazing.

Music and ambience supports the adventure greatly  imho. When you just run around in the field  the approach of enemies  the tense tunes of the heated battles are all just beautiful. Never I felt music or sounds out of place or out of pace. 

Again  there are problems. Technical problems like crashing  or texture not loading properly (my character suddenly didn't have a body when I equipped the shield weave a couple of times)  and other problems you can find in the forums. It's not a perfect game  but if you ask me whether I enjoy it  the answer is yes  very much.

Here is hoping that the sequel also comes to PC.

The story is pretty good from what I've seen so far. Cutscenes are actually interesting and I don't skip through them  like with some other games. In addition to the main quest line  there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy. Most of them have been simple but fun.

Combat is nice. Keep in mind that this is not a game where you can go all out against multiple enemies at once. This is a surefire way to end up dead. You can take on maybe one or two enemies at a time but the best strategy is to use ranged combat. Aloy has a variety of bows and tripwire-type traps at her disposal and it would behoove you to learn how to use them all. Aloy has the tools in her arsenal  so why not put them all to good use; the game gives you plenty of opportunity to do so. Either way  plan out your encounters and make the most of the weapons and terrain.

Exploration is also fun. The world is varied and rich. I find myself wandering about and constantly looking around in amazement at how beautiful the world is. If you have the appropriate hardware  crank this game up to max and let your jaw hit the floor.

That said  performance-wise  HZD seems to run great. Whatever bugs there were at launch have been fixed and the game runs smooth as butter on my system. I am running a 3700X  3080  16GB 3600 RAM and have the game installed on a 1TB 970 Evo Plus. I usually let the game run on my TV (LG CX 55"") and with everything at max settings and 4K  I average between 70-80 FPS. At 1440p  I get between 90-110. As stated  there have been no hiccups and the game runs smooth as butter.

All in all  my experience has been great. I can turn HZD on and before I know it  hours have passed and I have to force myself to turn the computer off. Coming from someone who was on the fence  I can only say to try this game out.

This game is breathtaking  in many ways  but mostly in art style/ visuals and story line. The characters you meet feel quite realistic in their personalities and the story is a nice blend of many fitting ingredients; futuristic and historic at the same time. A downside is maybe a bit too much religious superstition  but it fits the story pretty well. Also it is clearly a game developed in the first place for console. This is visible in the movement/fighting controls of the main character which can feel a bit clunky sometimes. And the insane loading time of 2 5 minutes in the start menu (while it's installed on my M2 SSD) was very awkward  but after running the optimization and a few more restarts it's now much better.

As it is  there is too much fighting  not enough peaceful lore and interaction for my tastes. To narrate Aloy (the main protagonist of the game): Just a few minutes of quiet. Usually that quiet doesn't last for minutes  if I don't try to be stealthy.

Since there is a constant need to gather resources  confrontations are unavoidable.

The Cauldrons are weird places  especially if considering they should have been built by modern technology standards.

Someties new machines appearing randomy still irritates me.

Upgraded my PC to 16GB RAM and it helped a lot. Very seldom loading lags after it and quitting the game went from a minute to a few seconds. 

I really enjoy the visuals while ""rappling down"" a cliff. 

I got the game when it was 1.08 so I have no technical issues. Although more weapon slots on a PC would be great.

Lo que en un principio fué un horrible port con muchos fallos gráficos y técnicos (perdí un save como de 8hrs después de que un NPC no apareció para continuar una misión)  terminó siendo una experiencia muy buena. Al principio  el juego me iba entre 30 y 40fps en medium settings  pero después del parche 1.05 ya me comenzó a ir a 60fps estables en altos  al menos un 95% del tiempo.

La historia es bastante interesante  la música es buena (sólo si me aburrió de a madres la música en el mapa/menú)  el doblaje de voz en español latino es muy bueno (aunque yo lo jugué en inglés  el lip sync es muy bueno)  el gameplay es bastante sencillo pero divertido y el sistema de inventario  skill tree  crafting y demás es bastante robusto y muy fácil cuando se le agarra la onda. En general  lo recomiendo.

PRO:
+Los gráficos: Corre muy bien con una 1660Ti  i5 9300H y 16Gb RAM desde un SSD.
+El doblaje en español latino: Empieza muy bien (escuchando a Rubén Moya)  pero en inglés considero que es mejor.
+El mapa es muy grande y hay muchas cosas por hacer/coleccionar.
+La duración: Te lo puedes aventar en unas 20horas si solo vas por la historia principal  aunque yo me aventé 50+ porque también jugué misiones secundarias y el DLC.
+El DLC: Te da bastantes horas de juego  mayor dificultad y muchos niveles de experiencia. Está integrado totalmente al juego como una misión secundaria.
+La historia: Al principio da flojera  pero ya para el final si te quedas con ganas de que ya salga el 2 (y obvio que tenga su port en PC).
+El precio: El precio es super competitivo y por la cantidad de horas de juego que te da  es un gran deal.

CONTRAS:
-El filtro anisotrópico NO sirve
-El DLC está como una misión secundaria mas  por lo que es confuso si se debe hacer antes de terminar el juego  o después  o en qué momento. Yo recomiendo hacerlo cuando ya se tenga un nivel 35 o bien  omitirlo si solo se quiere hacer la historia principal porque si son bastantes horas de juego (6-10).
-El sistema de inventario: Se llena de mucha porquería que no sabes si utilizarás mas adelante o no  es medio molesto tener que estar eliminando cosas.
-Muchísimo coleccionable (es bueno o malo según tu punto de vista).
-Al juego le hace falta un gancho tipo Far Cry Primal con la opción de poder subir rápidamente montañas en lugar de tener que estar rodeando todo.

En general  muy recomendable si te gustan juegos tipo Far Cry  AC (mas o menos como Odyssey) y un combate similar a la nueva trilogía de Tomb Raider (obvio sin pistolas  puro arco).",1609864325,1609864325,True,1,1,0.505617976188659668,0,True,False,False,,

Fun game overall  the world building is where this game shines don't expect too much from the combat  story or the characters too much.
1. Combat is alright but can be tedious or just annoying especially if you don't take advantage of using your focus to see weak points and its specially tedious at the higher difficulties and in the frozen wilds but can be fun if you learn weak points and attack patterns  (which aren't all that complicated a bit one dimensional)  but that's just the combats with the machines which can be summed up as pretty much 'Fun when learned but somewhat tedious and just a bit annoying at higher difficulties' it isn't that challenging even at the hardest difficulties if I'm honest. Though that is what i can say about combat with machines  combat with humans in this game pretty much sucks ass  grunts are almost always a single head shot and down (though there are some exceptions later on) but the 'boss' mobs are needlessly tanky  spear play against humans is terrible as well  for some reason they are like are all like immovable objects when hit by spear power attacks and yet you can knock over machines which would weigh hundreds of kilos or even tonnes and yet these 80 - 100 kg humans just phase tank that crap. 
2. The base game Story is pretty predictable and the only good stuff I can say about the story is the world building that comes with it  I won't spoil it but its just fun learning about why the world ended up this way and all the stuff surrounding it. The side missions don't add much either except maybe interacting with characters you could probably go through the the game without doing the side missions and you wouldn't have an experience much different from someone who has except for maybe levels  the first few hours spear upgrade  the hunters lodge weapons and the cauldron overrides.
2.5. The DLC Story is pretty well done and enjoyable especially doing it just before the final mission. Some of the enemies in this dlc though pretty much sum up up my tedious and annoying feelings on combat especially the final machine introduced  the additional world buildings is really good and introduces some information/concept which may become a focus in the next game.
3. Characters in this game are well NPCs  I know that seems dumb and obvious but well that's the best description I can really offer  there wasn't much depth to characters without you actively trying to find it in going through  all the dialog but the main side characters weren't all that interesting beyond like 3 of them  while the side missions with them had some fun moments they were pretty forgettable as characters. Aloy as much as I enjoyed playing as her was sometimes jarring to watch play through a cut scene because it felt like there her character wasn't consistent sometimes but overall i think shes an interesting character with some interesting stuff behind her (could put it better but I don't want to spoil story stuff). The additional lore side characters you find out about during the story were pretty interesting especially in the context of what was happening back with them. The main DLC characters were interesting added to the overall experience and I can't really say much about the beyond they were pretty average good characters some of the side character from the side quests were interesting but didn't really stick.
3.5 This point is probably one of if not the biggest gripe/mild irritation with this game that brought me out of my immersion at points in the story because it felt really ham-fisted and a little forced at points. It was inserting modern politics into a world which has supposedly become more tribal / 'regressed' from todays societal norms. I can tell of a few examples without spoiling too much  one being at the start of the game where you meet with the envoy of a previously hostile tribes leader  the sun king  and during the conversation she asks if there is ever been a 'sun queen' and he says no and that begins a conversation which just make sense in the context of the world that is shown  two this probably isn't really to do with anything overt but every main antagonist in this game has been male  every single one and most of the important NPCs with power bar like 2 or 3 are women as well which doesn't make much sense outside her Nora tribe because there is lore reasons  I mean I have no problem with women with powerful positions in general but when the skew is so large in a game that has humans regressed to tribal societies and survival requires strength in 9/10 cases it doesn't make sense for all the powerful people to be women. But I think its worse in the context that every antagonist is male and pretty much all the side characters you meet all have a women in their lives they view as braver and stronger than them. I don't know it doesn't effect the game to a large degree and at some points I enjoyed it but at some points it was like being whiplashed out of my immersion and cringing at some of the things said and i think my biggest disappointment with this stuff was the missed opportunity of making Aloy a mold breaking character in this new tribal society and it could have worked but you can't break something that's been broken  multiple times  that's why my biggest gripe with this is instead of actually making Aloy influence the breaking of the mold they instead pretended there is a mold to break while patting Aloy on the back for breaking the mold.
Conclusion:
Ultimately I think this a game worth a try because the overall story with all the world building is the best I've seen in a long time and the characters do have their moments. The visuals are really well done and exploring while a chore at times is one of this games charm points and the music that accompanies it is great as well and is hard to fault. While it was a bit buggy here and there there wasn't anything major and only crashed once in the second last mission when loading an area I pressed a lot of buttons at the same time. Probably going in my top 10 which may seem strange from the score and the way I went on in the section above but well while I said all that it isn't that bad and isn't noticeable outside of times it feels off putting it nicely  the score went down due to just a lot of inconvenient stuff that is in the game which all have to due with combat  exploration and item storage and the fact that a lot of the hours you get out of this game just seem padded out in the form of exploration and collecting with the side quest not really offering to much beyond track this or kill that but yeah. I hope this was helpful  I'm mainly doing this out of venting mostly and wanting to put my impressions down somewhere well I hope you enjoy the game if you do get as I really think its worth playing through at least once.",1609574412,1609574412,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False,,

The player character  Aloy  must go on a quest to investigate the origin of the machines and the fall of the previous civilization.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

•	Along her journey  Aloy will fight against machines and Human bandits. The design of the machines is really cool. Their appearance and behaviour is similar to animals such as horses  cows  tigers  bulls  crabs  crocodiles  hawks  or dinosaurs like the velociraptor  brontosaurus and t-rex. As well as melee attacks  some of them have laser weapons mounted on their back  or can spam fire or frost projectiles at you  and one machine even has a cloaking device.

•	Most bandits are armed with axe or bow  but their leaders have powerful heavy weapons like a minigun or grenade launcher  which you can pick up and use until they run out of ammo.

•	Aloy can wield a staff for melee attacks and various different types of bows which can shoot arrows enhanced with elemental damage. Fire does extra damage over time  frost will slow enemy movement and increase damage taken  while shock will stun them for a few seconds leaving them vulnerable to a critical melee attack. There’s also a really useful skill which lets you load up two or three arrows to fire simultaneously with any bow.

•	There’s a strong focus on using stealth  hiding in long grass to sneak past groups of powerful enemies  or getting close enough to perform a melee takedown on weaker enemies.

•	Combat can be quite tactical. One of my favourite weapons  the Tripcaster  lets you place explosive or shock tripwires on the ground  which will detonate when a machine runs over them. Before the start of a fight  I liked to place a few tripwires in strategic locations  between trees or rocks  then I’d stand with the tripwires between myself and the machines  shooting the machines with arrows while trying to lure them into charging through the tripwires.

•	Some machines have weak points that can be targeted to deal extra damage  or you can destroy their weapon components to reduce their threat to you  although this can be tricky when fighting against fast moving or flying enemies. Its actually easier when fighting bosses because of their huge size and slower movement.

•	You can unlock the ability to override machines to make them fight each other  or to use them as a mount to travel around the world quicker. I didn’t use mounts often because I quickly discovered that this will draw aggro from lots of nearby enemies (similar to driving a car in a Far Cry game)  so its less stressful to just sneak around on foot.

•	You can buy several outfits from traders which change Aloy’s appearance. Weapons and outfits can be upgraded with modifications which provide bonuses to various damage types  damage resistances  or stealth.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is very well written with an interesting sense of mystery  and I enjoyed slowly piecing together what happened in the old world. The conflict between Humans and machines has similarities to the likes of The Terminator and The Matrix.

•	Most side quests have unique stories which are of a similar quality level to those in Witcher 3  and much better than the copy and paste tasks usually found in open world games. Sometimes you’ll wander across machines and Humans fighting each other  while clearing bandit camps will allow friendly tribes to move in. All of these elements help to bring the world to life.

•	Voice acting is fantastic  especially Ashly Burch (who previously voiced Chloe in Life is Strange) as Aloy and Lance Reddick (Fringe  Quantum Break) who plays an important supporting character.

•	Lip syncing during cutscenes is the best I’ve seen since Hellblade Senua’s Sacrifice.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	The environment looks fantastic  from the forests  rivers and snowy mountains to deserts and ruined buildings of the old world.

•	I had a smooth framerate during combat with machines and while exploring the world. The only significant problems I encountered were around a few bandit camps where my framerate dipped into the 40s  I’m assuming this was caused by columns of smoke because I didn’t see them anywhere else. I had some minor framerate drops in large settlements of NPCs  which wasn’t the end of the world because it didn’t affect any fast paced gameplay.

•	It took me 61 hours to complete the main quest  expansion  and lots of side quests. During this time I only crashed twice  so the game was very stable for me. Both crashes occurred before the release of patch 1.06 so it seems that whatever was causing the problem has been fixed.

•	Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.

•	The camera has a mind of its own  sometimes changing position by itself. By default  Aloy will be slightly offset to the left of screen  like most third person games. However  there are times when the camera drifts so that Aloy is almost all the way to the right of the screen  which feels slightly disorienting. Its not an issue that makes the game unplayable  because you can immediately reset the camera position by aiming the bow. This also means its not a problem during combat because you’ll almost always be aiming. Its just a really strange design decision that doesn’t serve any purpose  and I can’t think of any other game I’ve played in the last few years where I’ve felt like I’m fighting the camera.

Combat and story are both excellent and while there are some technical flaws  they aren’t big enough reasons to avoid playing.

For a game that classified as an ""RPG"" game  this game is not too complex. So anyone can hop in and enjoying the game  the scenery  and the story. No Microtransaction and no 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  etc. It looks like they treat their PC customers better than some big game publisher out there (looking at you Ubisoft  etc). 

Compare the game performance at PC launch vs now  it's like night and day. At PC launch the game performance was so bad  but after several patches now the game run smoother than before.

And Aloy has same energy like reboot version of Lara Croft. Blitzing through their enemies primarily with a bow and arrow and still can win no matter how strong their enemies are. So Lovely. Make me interested in Archery even more.

[h1]Detailed Review :[/h1]
[b]Pros :[/b]
+ Beautiful Graphic and scenery.
+ Beautiful Bushes
+ Fairly good story
+ Good Gameplay
+ Built in Photo Mode
+ And Thank God  no microtranscation at all. And the resources for upgrading is not so scarce. ( Take a note Ubisoft )
+ No Overkill 3rd party DRM like Denuvo  VMProtect  etc ( Again  take a note Ubisoft. It's so weird when one of the console maker not using any multilayer of DRM and treat their PC customers so well and better than Ubisoft )

[b]Cons :[/b]
- Abysmal performance at launch or should I say bad port? . But after several patches  for me the game way lot smoother and better than before.
- Weird camera placement. I can't describe it perfectly  but something like this : Sometimes Aloy would shift from left side of the screen to the right side of the screen and vice versa when you wander around the world like sprinting  etc.

[b]Informational :[/b]
- Because I said earlier ""this game is not too complex""  so there is no multiple ending like most any recent RPG Open World games.

I really want to recommend this game. I do. It is an absolute masterpiece and I loved playing it… on the PS4. On PC this game is nearly unplayable unless you have only the top of the line hardware or willing to play one of the most beautiful games of the last generation on settings that make it look like minecraft. It barely hits 60fps with major graphical downgrades for me and I have a 2070 Super FTW3 card. The stuttering  the huge 20-30fps drops in places  the nearly 15 minutes you have to wait for shaders to load EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. It’s a mess. Now  will I remove my review if the Devs fix these issues? Absolutely. That hand will flip to a thumbs up and I will get to write a review about the gameplay itself. But  as it stands  you might be better off picking this game up on the PS4/5. And that pains me to say as a proud member of PCMR.

--Edit as of 11/27/20--
The dev is proving to be committed to this game and is patching it at a fast pace. Some issues have been fixed but many more remain. FPS is still very jittery and can rip you right out of the experience. While there is improvement  it might be many more months till this is what I consider playable.

--Edit as of 12/04/20--
I have 100% this game now  and let me tell you it was much easier on the PS4. The game would crash at the worst times and the frame lag would make some battles more about where  could I lure the enemy where I could get a smoother framerate rather than just trying to take down the enemy. A 40+ frame drop at the wrong time could mean having to reload a save.

I will say the 1.08 patch DID help with many of the issues  it just isn't enough though the devs are making great improvements. While I can not endorse this game as is  I highly suspect that will change in the future.

At that point  you're just ranting because you're mad that things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.

Edit: And enough to play through NG+ on Ultra Hard to get the last of the achievements ;)

If youve ever wanted to play Far Creed: Phantom Breath of the Wild Hunt Raiders Redemption  now is your chance. HZD plays like a mashup of all those games - which is both good and bad. 

Whats the bad? Almost everything can be compared to those other games  and the comparisons are frequently ""its almost as good as X but not quite"". Eg take the horse riding - it doesnt seem as good as RDR2  BOTW  or TW3  its not nearly as fluid or helpful  and instead I feel as though most of the time Im fighting a giant robot machine for control - which maybe I am. Which is a shame since you will end up spending so much time on horseback.

Whats the good? Being a blend of  and being compared to a bunch of superb games is quite an accomplishment. Combat  movement  economy  progression  ai  crafting  music  artwork  etc etc etc are all very good. 

Whats excellent? Stealth. Rocks  whistling  grass and telegraphed and forgiving AI all come together really well. I think the music and artwork are excellent  and I love the theme of the world - natural beauty and giant robot dinosaurs with laser breath! ""Squee!"" :)
 
Whats ""new"" in HZD then? Shooting giant dinosaurs with a variety of weapons to strip them of components+abilities  and to inflict status effects on them (maybe this is like Monster Hunter  but I havent played any of those). Hence the combat is a bit more cerebral than all of the games mentioned above. Anything else  anything else...? No? (Im sure if anyone reads this  someone will point out other novel stuff  but I cant remember it now).

Whats ""terrible"" (IMO): A large class of monster attacks knock Aloy to the ground/knock her back. This would be fine except a large class of Aloys attacks need to ""charge up"" (eg drawing the bow to max strength)  and so you have to frequently interrupt this  either by voluntarily rolling out of the way  or by getting hit and knocked down which also interrupts it. Some of Aloy's attacks (eg strong melee) cant be interrupted by rolling  so you'll just get knocked down. When you pick up heavy weapons  if you roll you drop them  so you have to pick them up again after. Its all very tiresome. The last time I recall being this annoyed by knockdown combat is Prototype (where the tank attacks would knock you about  stun locking you - to be clear though that was worse).

The writing is mixed: The overall story is an excellent concept  novel to me  and I really enjoyed it. The exposition through the world  text and speech  for key plot moments is superb  and backed my beautiful  haunting  fitting music  standout vs all the games Ive played in recent history and almost tear jerking. But most of it is incredibly forgettable filler stuff - fine to read/listen to  fine to ignore - but then again its hard to imagine a game with ~100 hours of play time with every written line being at the peak of the art form. The dialogue with characters can be skipped (with space) which is a blessing because while its not terrible  its fully generic and you cant make any choices of consequence - you cant make any choices at all IIRC  and hence there are no consequences for your actions  which is pretty bad for an RPG (ok  maybe there are some minor choices which involves getting a band of companions together  but this is super shallow).

There are a decent number of sidequests  errands (other side quests...?)  in addition to the main quests - Ive completed almost all of them now  but it never felt overwhelming (unlike eg the Far Creeds nearly infinite set of things to do on the map). Its quite nice having a game with such little filler. One gripe relates to the weapon tutorials - they dont progress unless you have the tutorial quest actively selected - but you can ignore them so thats fine.

Another major gripe is that just like the majority of the writing is forgettable  bland  generic and ultimately a bit pointless  so the same is true for the world map - its very pretty  but there is little point in ""exploration"" as an activity since when you get ""there""  there is nothing there. There is one ""secret special"" area of the game where if you collect a bunch of stuff during the main missions  by 90% through the game you can get a ""literally game changing"" set of armour (its not a secret though  its got a map marker and a quest associated with it...). This is in contrast to eg gothic where unique weapons could be found through random and persistent exploration all throughout the game but they were all totally missable if you didnt explore - I think it is a missed opportunity that there arent another 10-20 optional unique items which can be found purely through exploration - having this would add ""exploration"" as an extra dimension to the gameplay. I think if ~50% of the skill tree had been replaced by ""exploration found items"" the game would have felt more meaningful (or alternately if exploration found items were needed to unlock 50% of the skill tree).

All in all  I enjoyed HZD  even with its rough edges  and I would happily play a sequel (on PC). What core changes would I want to see in that?
- Choices that matter (dialogue and action)
- More ""cyber"" abilities in addition to the late game armour which dramatically mix up the gameplay  ala DX or Crysis3  discovered through the world.
- Less ""crap  med  good  great bow""  and more discovery of unique old world weapons. (More variety  less progression).
- Much less knock-down attacks  or much shorter ""build"" times for your attacks.
- Get rid of the inventory limits  managing those are a chore not a pleasure.
- A constant companion we can become attached to - horse  dog  cat  bird whatever. ""Dial a random horse"" is functional  but a missed emotional opportunity. Also  a permanent horse could be used for carrying excess inventory  necessitate fixing and upgrading  etc etc etc - all missed opportunities in HZD.
- An inventory ""wheel""  like the weapon wheel.
- Probably some more stuff  but this review is long enough already. :)",1609486204,1609741958,True,3,0,0.555555582046508789,0,True,False,False,,

I encountered one loading bug where I had to restart the game and one minor visual bug with foliage that cleared away after a short while in my 84 hours of playing the game (as of this writing). Whatever performance issues there were in the past  it seems the Guerrilla team has resolved it.

[b][u]Game Review[/u][/b]
The open world landscape is picturesque and makes you want to use photo mode a lot. Combat is solid and makes you feel like a hunter. I really liked the progression of how the story unfolded.

Ever since the release on Play Station and seeing how good of a game it was (drawing lots of inspiration from Witcher)  watching various streamers playing it  I hoped it would come to PC too  but since Guerilla Games only made Play Station exclusives I wasn't expecting any. So I was excited to play it on PC when it was actually announced to come to PC. The disappointment was big though when not only people reported lots of trouble playing it  but on top of that all  on my system for some reason it was not even able to start up at all. So I had to ask for a refund.

By far one of the greatest open-world RPGs ever created. I've been collecting dust and nothing else since it released on PS4 in February of 2017. When it released on PC this year in 2020  I shook off the grime and Steam slapped my ass with a fresh matte coat and told me [i]""get ready for a four day bender""[/i] as I emptied my wallet. Little did Steam know I got more than my money's worth. I didn't just get a game. I got one of the best.

[b]Port to PC[/b]
PS4 to PC was done right by this one. The controls feel right  there's no clunky-ness or re-adjustments needed. Only setting I've ever altered was the FOV cause the camera felt a little off. Majority of the negative reviews are people complaining that they can't get it to run. It works fine  you just need a good build to do it. Know why? Because this game was actually ported right and they made it look amazing on Ultra.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Environments— astounding. Hell  I'd take one as a wallpaper and put it up in my house. Framed. Maybe get it from one of those metal poster people. Real nice. I'm not gonna lie  you're gonna question your gravitational pull with all the hair clipping into keyframes. And I've only witnessed Aloy's model reaching up to the heavens one time  so let's just say model glitches are minimal.

[b]Story[/b]
Writers— pay raise when? They did a fucking fantastic job  that's putting it lightly. It's so [i]surreal[/i] how down to Earth it is; How emotionally invested you get in the main character. How intrigued you get through each step in the plot ladder. How their take on what such a world would be like is actually understandable (trying to avoid spoilers here). Damn  even some of the side quests hit you like a fucking red light runner. By the end of the game— if you've done everything  majority of the cast has gone through character development. And once you've seen it all. . . it tugs on your heartstrings man.
But if you don't give a damn about the story  you'll definitely enjoy the

[b]Combat[/b]
Bows and arrows aren't the only thing Aloy is known for. I'm gonna have to leave it at that to avoid spoilers. Depending on what you're fighting  it goes from 0-100 real quick and then it's all about strategy and acting fast. You have a wide variety of ways to handle a fight. It doesn't hand-hold you through them either. You gotta learn what you can use against your targets by yourself. Read the Notebook to memorize weaknesses. Use those invis frames you get from dodge rolls  don't be afraid to give up that fully charged shot in favor of getting the hell out of the way. The easier difficulty  the more disinterested you'll be in combat. Do yourself a favor in whip that baby up  just save Ultra Hard for New Game+.

[b]Overall[/b]
Horizon's a damn good game. Yes  there's times when Aloy goes blind and misses the platforming jump. And yes  there's some slight vibe kills when the model makes the wrong expression or when all of the sudden you're stuck inside of a rock hearing combat music.
But these are [i]small[/i] issues. Small! There's definitely other weird bugs that have been noticed by other people. But what's a video game without some these days?
Good outways the bad too much on this one.

Firstly  because the PC port had a very rough launch and there are still complaints of issues popping up from time to time. Secondly  because I wasn't sure if the idea of fighting robots would really be that enjoyable past a few hours or less.

Well  regarding the first concern  it seems they've done  good job at patching this up and getting it into a more playable state. I'm about 20 hours into the game now and I've yet to encounter a single bug or crash. The worst I have seen is a floating bush or piece of scenery here and there  and such things are really rare. I'm not sure if my hardware has anything to do with my lack of issues  so I will say that I'm using an RX 5700 8GB  16GB of RAM  and an AMD Ryzen 3600.

Regarding the second concern - this is where I think the game has done a great job. You are a very young hunter armed with only a few traps  bows  and a spear  going up against massive technologically advanced robots that look like they could topple entire buildings. I think the way the game handles this bizarre juxtaposition is pretty clever. If you run head-on at enemy machines with your spear swingin'  you will almost certainly die - especially at higher difficulties (there are many  including New Game+). Even if you vastly outlevel the enemy  this tactic will still get you beat up pretty good. The key to survival and victory is to handle each enemy on a case-by-case basis and to learn and know their strengths and weaknesses. From using specialised arrows to bust off parts of the robots or using fire to set their fuel stores alight - the way you take these mechanical beasts done is both satisfying and entertaining. Especially when they collapse to the ground with a gratifying thump of jingling parts and sparks. You can attack the machines from a more aggressive angle  dancing around them while strategically damaging them enough to kill them  or you can move in the shadows and thin the herd one-by-one through target analysis and well placed spear jabs. Combat is fast  hectic  and the bigger bots can take off 3/4 of your health in a single swipe of their metal claws or jaws.

As for the other usual stuff: Graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is astounding. Everything on Aloy's body has physics applied  from her hair down to the small beads that hang from her bow. She shivers when it's cold and complains when she has water in her boots. Her movement is entirely terrain-dependant and she will interact with foliage when moving through the world. I find this sort of thing important in a game where you will be spending hours looking at a character through a third-person perspective. I'm not sure what my frame rate is as I'm not running a FPS counter when I play  but I'd say it's floating around 60 with everything but AA and shadows maxed. They have improved the performance with patches but apparently this game is a system hog  so if you have lower specs you might want to make sure you stay within your 2-hour return window just in case.

The sound and music are good  although I will say that I wish the audio quality on voice lines was higher. You can tell that the audio is compressed and not mastered as good as everything else. It's a minor complaint and it doesn't really detract from the rest of the game  but it is noteworthy.

One last thing I wanted to note. The game has a fast travel system but it requires resources  which I think is awesome. You need to craft travel packs that have things for your travel such as meat and materials. Seems like a great way of having a fast travel system while avoiding the teleport-everywhere issue that Skyrim had.",1609608111,1609608111,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False,,

It's not a perfect port  however  as I still experience the occasional crash  but it seems well improved from when it was first released to PC  as they are continuing to release patches.

Excellent Port overall - had no issues with running the game and playing with KBM. Some weird frame drops in some areas but nothing game breaking. On a i5 7600k and a 1080ti  I can achieve 60FPS 80% of the time on a 1600p Ultrawide.

I also run this on my second PC  which has an i5 8600k and a 1080  hooked to a 1080p projector. Runs on default Favour Quality (High) at mostly steady 60fps.

 In general  if you're like me and enjoy Open World RPGs  then this is a must get on a Sale. Games/series you would also enjoy would be Witcher 3  RDR2  Assassin's Creed  Tomb Raider  Batman  Middle-Earth  Fall Out 3 - 4  Elder Scrolls  Borderlands  Far Cry  Bioshock (less open)  Dishonored (less open).",1609553949,1609554727,True,3,0,0.524735093116760254,0,True,False,False,,

Oh  you probably want a review  right?  Okay.

[b]Negatives.[/b]

Occasionally there's some stuttering  but it's been minor.  Rarely the game seems to freeze or pause for a fraction of a second.  It's only happened a couple times in 14 hours and hasn't really been a problem  it's just annoying.

Once in a while when using the scan ability the effects that usually pop up simply fail to appear.  It doesn't really affect gameplay and it always corrects itself in a few seconds  but it's like the game just forgets to render it once in a while.

There are a few little things that could be improved.  You collect a lot of loot but some has no use other than to sell to a trader but there is no ""sell all junk"" option.  You have to go through your inventory to find each of these items every time.  It's not a big deal but a sell all treasure/junk button would be nice.  Or just auto sell it because it's not used for anything else. 

A shader optimization starts every single time you boot up the game that takes an insanely long time.  It does speed up load times  but you don't have to wait for it and in my opinion it's not really worth waiting up to 10 minutes or more for it every time you start up the game.

I ran into one glitch where a small  weak enemy got stuck in a rock but I was still able to kill it when it moved to a certain spot.  Climbing and jumping doesn't quite work the way you'd expect all the time.  I've fallen a few times when it was clear that the character should have jumped on to a post  or other surface.  It's not always obvious what you can climb  and sometimes you can't climb some things that would actually be easier than some of the things you can climb.

[b]The good stuff.[/b]

Crafting is quick and easy  especially making ammo since you can craft it from the radial menu where you select weapons.

Looting doesn't take too long like it can in some games.  The looting animation is short  and there's a loot all button.

Combat is fun and there are a lot of ways to go about taking down enemies.  You can run in firing arrows and attacking with your spear or take a stealthy approach to pick off one enemy at a time.  You can use traps and distractions.  You can switch weapons quickly in combat and when switching weapons there is a a bullet time mechanic  time slows significantly when you bring up the radial weapon menu.  You can also unlock abilities that let you slow time while aiming ranged weapons in different situations such as while jumping  sliding  or simply aiming normally.  There are precision and area effect weapons  weapons and traps that burn  freeze  electrocute  or even rend more parts off some of the enemies.  Most weapons have multiple ammo types and swapping on the fly is quite easy.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you aren't careful  but it's not too hard to get away from most enemies.

There's a decent size skill tree in the game and early on you can focus on gathering  melee  ranged combat  stealth takedowns  and a few other things.  As you level you get tougher but also get a point to spend on skills.  Higher tier skills cost more  and all skills above the first rank of skills have prerequisite skills.  It's possible to carry several types of weapons  armour  traps  and utility items such as healing and resistance potions early in the game and as you expand your storage space you can eventually carry a lot more.  This is important as you progress because different weapons and armour are better in some situations and against some enemies.

Overall the GUI is well made and easy to use.  The menu system works well and looks good.  The graphics  sound  music  animation  and overall look of the game is all great.  I notice little things here and there  like a few hairs out of place on the main character or the slight scar on one NPC's forehead  a character whose chin wrinkles as she speaks or another who tends to smile a lot.  These little things add a lot to the game.  The voice acting is generally good  too  and there is a lot of spoken dialogue.  So far I've found the story fairly interesting  if a tad predictable.

There are a lot of difficulty settings  and also aim assist that you can toggle  so if you just want to enjoy the story or want combat to be challenging (or nigh-impossible) then you can adjust it accordingly.

Otherwise  the game will take control of your character  move you to a different scene  and you will loose all loot from unlooted bodies/chests/plants/objects on the ground. The game rewards you for searching for items everywhere  but steals your opportunities if you chat with a plot based NPC  loot a boss's body  or move forward to a quest destination. At least I don't have to worry about losing quest opportunities by not using all dialog options.

I am tired of games that find it ok to  take away your gear  take control of your character  leave you in the open to be attacked  forcefully move your character in a battle scene to be a open target  and otherwise work against you.

The character you play is slow  complains too much  is weak  cannot dodge attacks  rolls faster on the ground than she can run  her father is weak  the character is unrealistic  and the entire tribe claims to be about survival but is not. I don't believe in the philosophy of the tribe  am tired of the tribe ripping the player character a new hole  providing no support  showing no respect  and not even caring to live. The plot hole of the tribe surviving a full on tribal attack is apparently forced upon you as no one claimed to hide.

I love the mechanics  but must say one more thing. How can you not get annoyed with a NPC constantly yelling  ""I'm over here...over here...over here...come save me...someone come save me...I'm over here...I'm over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here...come save me...over here....over here....over here...over here...over here..."" I find myself saving the game just so I can practice eliminating the annoying NPCs just to find they are invincible. The NPC yells and no creature/monster can see them. I stand on the same platform where the NPC was at  stand up  and creatures shoot at me. At the very least  can the NPC whisper or waive me down. The programmers treat the player as incompetent to play the game when they must give constant verbal notification of where the NPC is located. This has driven me angry at the game. If it was not for the great mechanics  I would have quit this story a long time ago.",1610018597,1610018694,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,,

The engagement options are endless  full stealth  full aggression  diversionary  traps  status effects  and even making the machines fight for you.
